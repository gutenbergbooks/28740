<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>WHERE, OH, WHERE?</h3>
</div>
<p>Field day was past and gone and the senior
class of Central High, Centerport&#8217;s largest and
most popular school, was thinking of little but
white dresses, bouquets, and blue-ribboned diplomas.</p>
<p>The group of juniors, however, who had made
the school&#8217;s athletic record for the year in the
Girls&#8217; Branch Athletic League, had other matters
to discuss&mdash;and in their opinion they were matters
of much greater moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boiled down,&#8221; stated Bobby Hargrew, &#8220;to
its last common divisor, it is &#8216;Where, oh, where
shall we spend our vacation?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>They had decided some weeks before&mdash;Bobby
herself, Laura Belding, Jess Morse, the Lockwood
twins and Dr. Agnew&#8217;s daughter, Nellie&mdash;that
a portion at least of the long summer vacation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
should be spent in camp. The mooted question
was, where?</p>
<p>&#8220;No seashore resort,&#8221; Nellie said, with more
decision than she usually displayed, for Nellie
was of a timid and peaceful disposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Laura Belding. &#8220;We&#8217;ll eschew
the three S&#8217;s&mdash;&#8216;sun, sand, and &#8217;skeeter-bites.&#8217;
That is the slogan of the seashore resort. Besides,
it costs too much to get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an important item to take into consideration,
girls, if <i>I&#8217;m</i> to go,&#8221; said Jess Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were a millionairess?&#8221; laughed
Bobby. &#8220;Where are the royalties from your
play?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those won&#8217;t begin till the producer puts the
play on next season,&#8221; returned Jess, who had
been fortunate in writing a play for amateur production
good enough to interest a professional
theatrical manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got to have <i>you</i>, Jess,&#8221; said
Bobby (otherwise Clara) Hargrew. &#8220;For we&#8217;re
depending upon your mother to play chaperon for
the crowd, wherever we go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s find a quiet spot, then,&#8221; said Jess,
eagerly. &#8220;Mother wants to write a book this
summer and she says she would love to be somewhere
where she doesn&#8217;t need to play the society
game, or dress&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the Garden of Eden for hers!&#8221;
chuckled Bobby. &#8220;Eve didn&#8217;t have to dress&mdash;that
is, not before <i>Fall</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you awful, Bobby?&#8221; cried one of the
Lockwood twins&mdash;but <i>which</i> one it was who
spoke could not have been sworn to by their most
familiar friend. Dora and Dorothy looked just
alike, dressed just alike, their voices were alike,
and they usually acted in perfect harmony, too!</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; pursued Laura Belding, &#8220;if we are
going to spend the first weeks of the summer
vacation in camp, we must decide upon the spot
at once. Are we all agreed that we shall not go
to the salt water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; cried her particular chum, Jess, or
Josephine, Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of the troubles of the seaside boarder
for ours,&#8221; Bobby announced, hurriedly groping
amid the rubbish in her skirt pocket and bringing
forth a crumpled newspaper clipping. Bobby insisted
upon having a pocket in almost every garment
she wore (it was whispered that she wore
pajamas at night for that reason) and no boy
ever carried a more heterogeneous collection in
his pockets than she did.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here! here&#8217;s one seaside visitor&#8217;s complaint,&#8221;
and she intoned in a singsong voice the
following doggerel:

<p>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; shrieked Jess, covering her ears.
&#8220;How <i>dare</i> you read such preposterous stuff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whys to the wise,&#8217; you know,&#8221; giggled
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vote we refuse to allow Bobby to go camping
with the crowd unless she positively refrains
from quoting verse on any and every occasion,&#8221;
drawled Nellie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hardhearted creature!&#8221; cried Dora Lockwood.
&#8220;Poor Bobs couldn&#8217;t live without that
&#8217;scape-gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, girls,&#8221; Laura Belding asked,
briskly, &#8220;are we going to let any other girls join
this camping party&mdash;or is it to be just us six?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else wants to go?&#8221; demanded Bobby,
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lil Pendleton&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always that!&#8221; ejaculated Bobby, in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Bobby!&#8221; cried Dorothy. &#8220;I thought
you and Lilly kissed and made up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;we did,&#8221; grunted the smaller girl.
&#8220;That is, we kissed. Lil was already made up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Bobby!&#8221; admonished Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s horrid of you, Bobby,&#8221; Nellie declared.
&#8220;You are incorrigible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet they all had to laugh. Bobby Hargrew
<i>was</i> just a cut-up!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worse than the long word you called me,
Nell,&#8221; said little Miss Hargrew. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not
going to have any such spoil-sport as Lil Pendleton
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Chet and Lance say that Prettyman
Sweet has begged so hard to go camping with
<i>them</i>, that they&#8217;re going to take him&mdash;just for
the fun they will have at his expense, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221;
said Laura.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why Lil wants to go camping,&#8221; Dora
said. &#8220;She&#8217;s got such an awful crush on Pretty
Sweet that she wants to do everything he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That dude!&#8221; scoffed Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;He and Lil make a good pair,&#8221; said Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; cried Dorothy Lockwood.
&#8220;Where are the boys going to camp this year,
Laura?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the shore of Lake Dunkirk, somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mother Wit,&#8221; cried Bobby, addressing
by her universal nickname the leader of the crowd
of Central High girls. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun to
camp near&mdash;That is, providing the boys are all
nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, beside Chet and Lance and Pretty
Sweet, there&#8217;ll be Short and Long, Reddy Butts
and Arthur Hobbs, anyway. I don&#8217;t know how
many more,&#8221; Laura said. &#8220;But you know that
Chet and Lance wouldn&#8217;t have any but nice fellows
in their crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Barring Pretty,&#8221; said Bobby, &#8220;they are all
good chaps&mdash;so far. We wouldn&#8217;t mind having
them for neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why can&#8217;t we?&#8221; she added, suddenly.
&#8220;Why, girls! Father Tom has recently bought
into the Rocky River Lumber Company and that
company owns Acorn Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Acorn Island? Great!&#8221; declared Jess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the big island in Lake Dunkirk, you
know,&#8221; explained Laura to the Lockwood twins,
who looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acorn Island is just the finest kind of a place
for a camp,&#8221; said the enthusiastic Jess. &#8220;It&#8217;s
just like a wilderness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right! The company isn&#8217;t going to cut the
timber on the island till next winter. Father
Tom says so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to picnics on Acorn Island,&#8221; said
Nellie Agnew. &#8220;It <i>is</i> a beautiful spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Acorn Island it is, then,&#8221; cried Bobby.
&#8220;Hurrah! We&#8217;ll spend our vacation there!&#8221;</p>
<p>She almost shouted this declaration. The girls
had been lingering to talk in the high school yard
and were now at the gate. Nellie suddenly
tugged at Laura&#8217;s sleeve and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look there! <i>what</i> do you suppose is the matter
with Professor Dimp?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby spun around at the word, having heard
the sibilant whisper. She likewise stared at the
rusty-coated gentleman who had just passed the
gate, having come from the main entrance of the
Central High building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; exclaimed the slangy Bobby.
&#8220;What&#8217;s got Old Dimple now? What have <i>I</i>
ever done to him&mdash;except massacre the Latin
language?&mdash;and that&#8217;s a &#8216;dead one,&#8217; anyway!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>The Latin teacher&mdash;the bane of all careless and
ill-prepared boys and girls of the Latin class&mdash;was
a slightly built, stoop-shouldered man who
never seemed to own a new coat, and was as forgetful
as a person really could be, and be allowed
to go about without a keeper.</p>
<p>He often passed the members of his class on
the street without knowing them at all; the boys
said you might as well bow to a post as to Old
Dimple!</p>
<p>But here he had taken particular notice of
Bobby Hargrew; indeed, he stopped to turn
around and glare right at her&mdash;just as though she
had said something particularly offensive to him
as he passed the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; murmured Jess. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not
in trouble with Gee Gee, Bobs, you manage to
get one of the other instructors down on you.
What have you done to the professor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, I declare!&#8221; said Bobby, plaintively.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d murdered his grandmother he
couldn&#8217;t look any harder at you,&#8221; chuckled Dora
Lockwood.</p>
<p>The professor suddenly saw that he had disturbed
the party of schoolgirls. He actually
flushed, and turned hurriedly to move away.</p>
<p>As he did so he pulled a big, blue-bordered
handkerchief from the tail pocket of his frock-coat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
That pocket was notably a &#8220;catch-all&#8221;
for anything the poor, absent-minded professor
wished to save, or to which he took a fancy.
Once Short and Long (otherwise a very short
boy named Long) dropped a kitten into the professor&#8217;s
tail pocket and the gentleman did not discover
it until he reached for his bandana to wipe
his moist brow when he stood up to lecture his
Latin class.</p>
<p>However, it was nothing like a kitten that followed
the blue-bordered handkerchief out of the
voluminous skirt-pocket. A crumpled clipping
from a newspaper fell to the walk as Professor
Dimp strode away.</p>
<p>Bobby Hargrew&#8217;s quick eye noted the clipping
first, and she darted to retrieve it. She came back
more slowly, reading the printed slip.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Bob?&#8221; asked Jess, idly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Clara!&#8221; exclaimed Laura Belding,
&#8220;aren&#8217;t you going to give it back to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, girls!&#8221; ejaculated the excited and
thoughtless Bobby, looking up from the newspaper
clipping. &#8220;What do you think of this?
Old Dimple must be secretly interested in modern
crime as well as in the murdered ancient languages.
This is all about those forgeries in the
Merchants and Miners Bank, of Albany. You
know, they say a young fellow&mdash;almost a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
boy&mdash;did them; and he can&#8217;t be found and they don&#8217;t
know what he did with the money obtained by
the circulating of the false paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My! Our Aunt Dora lost some securities.
She just wrote us about it,&#8221; Dorothy Lockwood
said, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he wasn&#8217;t much but a boy!&#8221; murmured
Nellie. But Laura said, sharply: &#8220;Bobby!
that&#8217;s not nice. Run after Professor Dimp and
give the clipping to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! you&#8217;re so awfully particular,&#8221; grumbled
the harum-scarum. But she started after the
shabby figure of the Latin teacher and caught up
with him before Professor Dimp had reached the
end of the next block&mdash;for Bobby Hargrew had
taken the palm in the quarter mile dash at the
Girls&#8217; Branch League Field Day and there were
few girls at Central High who could compete
with her as a sprinter.</p>
<p>When she returned to the group of her friends,
still eagerly discussing the plane for their camping
trip, her footsteps lagged. Laura noticed the
curious expression on the smaller girl&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>has</i> happened you, Bobby?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! I&#8217;m so surprised,&#8221; gasped Bobby. &#8220;I
must have done something <i>awful</i> to Old Dimple.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
When he saw what it was I handed him, he
grabbed it and just snarled at me:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where did you get that, Miss Hargrew?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when I told him, he looked as though he
didn&#8217;t believe me and had to search his pocket
to make sure he <i>had</i> dropped it. And he looked
at me so fiercely and suspiciously. Goodness! I
don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ve done to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s odd, you know,&#8221; suggested Mother Wit.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Bobby, somewhat
tartly; &#8220;but what the mischief he wants to bother
himself about where we go camping&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Bobs?&#8221; demanded Jess,
while the other girls all looked amazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why he said to me just now,&#8221; answered the
disturbed girl, &#8220;&#8216;you girls better keep away
from Acorn Island. That&#8217;s no place for you to
go camping.&#8217; And then walked right off with
his old clipping, and without giving me a chance
to ask him what he meant,&#8221; concluded Bobby
Hargrew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>PLANS FOR THE SUMMER</h3>
</div>
<p>Bobby Hargrew came to school the next morning
with rather a sour face for her. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
matter, dear?&#8221; asked Nell Agnew, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I were a bird,&#8221; grumbled Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you could soar into the circumambient
ether and leave all mundane things below?&#8221;
queried Jess Morse, with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bobby, in disgust. &#8220;So I wouldn&#8217;t
have a toothache. I was up with one of my old
grinders half the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have it pulled,&#8221; suggested Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; cried Bobby. &#8220;That&#8217;s the easiest
thing in the world to say and the hardest to do.
And you know it, Mother Wit! You can have
an old toothache that will make you feel like committing
suicide; and when you get to the dentist
shop you wish you <i>had</i> committed suicide before
you got there,&#8221; and jolly little Bobby began to
grin again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suicide is a serious matter,&#8221; said Nellie,
gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, surely,&#8221; the cut-up replied, dropping
her voice to a gruesome pitch. &#8220;Listen!</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;&#8216;Beside a sewer a man lay dead,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>A dagger in his side;</span><br />
The coroner&#8217;s decision read:<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>&#8221;He died of suicide.&#8220;</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&#8216;Now if this man at home in bed,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>Had in this manner died,</span><br />
Then could the coroner have said:<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>&#8220;He died of homicide&#8221;?&#8217;</span></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Never joke about serious things, Nell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Bobby!&#8221; commanded Laura Belding.
&#8220;Tell us, do, if your father has agreed to let us
go camping on Acorn Island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied the younger girl. &#8220;And
he says there is a cabin there that can be made
tight for ten dollars. It&#8217;s all right to camp under
canvas; but if a big storm should come up he says
we&#8217;d be glad of that cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; announced Jess Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cabin shall be your mother&#8217;s particular
shelter,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;Eh, girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she is kind enough to go with us,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Nellie, &#8220;she should have the very best of everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She can have <i>my</i> share of the wood ants and
red spiders,&#8221; chuckled Bobby. &#8220;But it&#8217;s all right,
girls. Father Tom says we can have the island
to ourselves. And believe me: this bunch of girls
of Central High will sure have a good time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Which was a prophecy likely to be fulfilled, if
the past adventures of these same girls were any
criterion of the future.</p>
<p>For more than a year now the girls of Central
High, together with those of the other two high
schools of Centerport and the high schools of
Lumberport and Keyport&mdash;all five&mdash;had been
deeply interested in the Girls&#8217; Branch League
athletics. In following the various games and exercises
approved by their instructor, Mrs. Case
these six girls introduced above, had engaged in
many and varied enterprises and adventures.</p>
<p>In &#8220;The Girls of Central High; Or, Rivals for
All Honors,&#8221; the first volume of this series, Laura
Belding (&#8220;Mother Wit&#8221;) was enabled to interest
one of the wealthiest men of Centerport in girls&#8217;
athletics so that he gave a large sum toward the
preparation of a handsome athletic field and gymnasium
for Central High.</p>
<p>The second volume is entitled: &#8220;The Girls of
Central High on Lake Luna,&#8221; and the third is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
&#8220;The Girls of Central High at Basket Ball&#8221;&mdash;the
titles of which tell their own story.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Girls of Central High on the Stage,&#8221;
the fourth volume, tells of the writing and first
production by her mates of Jess Morse&#8217;s successful
play, while the fifth of the series is entitled:
&#8220;The Girls of Central High on Track and Field;
Or, Champions of the School League.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura, Jess, Nellie, the Lockwood Twins and
Bobby were girls of dissimilar characters (that
is, if we count Dora and Dorothy as &#8220;one and
indivisible&#8221; like the Union of the States).
Laura&#8217;s brother Chetwood, his chum, Lance
Darby, Billy Long, and some of the other Central
High boys were usually entangled in the girls&#8217;
adventures&mdash;sufficiently to give spice to the incidents.</p>
<p>So, all considered, it was only reasonable that
the girls should have eagerly agreed upon the site
of their summer camp&mdash;Acorn Island. They
knew that the boys would probably have their own
camp on one shore or the other of the lake, and
within sight of the island.</p>
<p>Chet, who seldom failed to walk home with
Jess and carry her books&mdash;unless the gymnasium
called the girls after the school session&mdash;and
Lance, who filled like office of faithful squire to
Laura, joined the girl chums on this afternoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Got it all planned, have you?&#8221; Chet said.
&#8220;I hear Acorn Island is going to be overrun with
a gang of female Indians right after graduation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have got to go up there to keep watch of
you boys,&#8221; laughed his sister. &#8220;But it&#8217;s nice of
Bobby&#8217;s father to let us camp there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull&mdash;sheer pull,&#8221; grumbled Lance. &#8220;We
fellows tried our best to get permission to camp
on the Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jess, demurely. &#8220;You can come
to the island visiting. It will be perfectly proper.
My mother says she will go to chaperon us, now
that she knows there is a cabin there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Bobby&#8217;s father is going to send a couple
of men up from Lumberport to make the cabin
tight and fix things up a little for us. We&#8217;ll pitch
our tents on the knoll right by the cabin,&#8221; Laura
said, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty spot,&#8221; agreed Chet. &#8220;We&#8217;ll probably
have our camp in sight of it and the lake between
the south shore and the island is only about two
miles broad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! we&#8217;ll have a bully time,&#8221; his chum agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; Chet said, suddenly, addressing Lance
Darby. &#8220;What was professor Dimp saying to
you about camping? I heard a word or two.
Something about going to the island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! I forgot to tell you about that,&#8221; returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
Lance, quickly, while the two girls cast enquiring
glances at each other. &#8220;Old Dimple is
certainly an odd stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As odd as Dick&#8217;s hat-band,&#8221; agreed Chet.</p>
<p>&#8220;And no-end forgetful. He&#8217;s been worse than
ever lately. There certainly is something worrying
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You boys,&#8221; laughed Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something worse than boys,&#8221; Lance returned.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame how forgetful he is. Say! did
you hear what he did at Mr. Sharp&#8217;s the other
night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the others, in chorus.</p>
<p>Lance began to chuckle. Mr. Franklin Sharp
was the principal of Central High, and was very
much admired by all the pupils; while Professor
Dimp, because of his harshness and his queer
ways, was the butt of more than a few jokes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was night before last when it rained so
hard,&#8221; resumed Lance. &#8220;He was there going
over Latin exercises or something, with the Doctor.
Mrs. Sharp asked him to stay all night, when
it came on so hard to rain, and the old Prof
thanked her and said he would.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sharp went into his office to do something
or other and left Old Dimple in the library for a
while. The family lost track of him then. Right
in the middle of the hardest downpour, about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
eleven o&#8217;clock, the front door bell rang, and Mr.
Sharp went to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was Old Dimple, under a dripping umbrella,
his pants wet to the knees, and his pajamas
and toothbrush under his arm&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lance!&#8221; ejaculated Laura. &#8220;That is too
much to believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fact. He&#8217;d gone home for his nightclothes.
I got it from our hired girl and she got it from
Mrs. Sharp&#8217;s maid. So, there you have it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t tell us what the old Prof was
saying to you about camping,&#8221; reminded Chet,
when the general laugh was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! that&#8217;s so. And it was odd, too, that he
should take any interest in what we fellows were
going to do this summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about it?&#8221; Jess asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted to know if we were going to pitch
our camp, too, on Acorn Island? He seemed to
know you girls were going there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How odd!&#8221; murmured Laura and Jess, together.
And the latter added: &#8220;Bobby said he
seemed mad when he found out <i>we</i> were going to
Acorn Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled Lance, &#8220;he seemed sort of
relieved when I told him we fellows were going
to camp on the mainland.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Funny he should trouble his head about us
out of school hours at all,&#8221; Chet said again.</p>
<p>His sister made no further comment upon the
professor&#8217;s queer actions. Nevertheless her curiosity
was aroused regarding the old instructor&#8217;s
sudden interest in anything beside Latin exercises
and Greek roots.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>VISITORS&#8217; DAY</h3>
</div>
<p>The afternoon preceding the closing exercises
of Central High was Visitors&#8217; Day at the
girls&#8217; gymnasium. This was an entirely different
affair from the recent Field Day when Laura
Belding and her particular friends had so well
distinguished themselves.</p>
<p>On <i>that</i> occasion the general public had been invited.
Visitors&#8217; Day might better have been called
&#8220;Mothers&#8217; Day.&#8221; Mrs. Case personally invited
all those mothers who had shown little interest, or
positive objection, to their daughters&#8217; athletic
activities.</p>
<p>For to the Centerport ladies the fact that their
daughters were being trained &#8220;like prize-ring
fighters,&#8221; as one good but misled mother had said
in a letter to the newspaper, was not only a novel
course but was considered of doubtful value.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you must come, Mother,&#8221; begged Laura,
when Mrs. Belding seemed inclined to make excuses.
Mrs. Belding was one of the mothers who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
could not approve of her daughter&#8217;s interest in
athletics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Laura, I am not sure that I should
enjoy myself seeing you crawl about those ladders
like a spider&mdash;or climbing ropes like a sailor&mdash;or
turning on a trapeze like a monkey&mdash;or otherwise
making yourself ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother!&#8221; half-laughed Laura. Yet she
was a little hurt, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, Mother, don&#8217;t sidestep your plain
duty,&#8221; said Chet, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chetwood! You know very well that I do
not approve of many of these modern dances.
I certainly do not &#8216;sidestep&#8217;&#8221;&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t a dance, Mother,&#8221; giggled Laura.</p>
<p>Her husband chuckled at the other end of the
table. &#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, suavely, &#8220;you should
keep up with the times&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you. I have no desire to. Keeping
up with the times, as you call it, has made my
son speak a language entirely unintelligible to <i>my</i>
ear, and has made my daughter an exponent of
muscular exercises of which I cannot approve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; said her husband, easily. &#8220;Basketball,
and running, and rowing, and the exercise
she gets at that gymnasium, aren&#8217;t going to hurt
Mother Wit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go!&#8221; exclaimed his wife. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
have begun to apply to Laura an appellation
which she has gained since all this disturbance
over athletics among the girls, has arisen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can no more than expect,&#8221; went on Mrs.
Belding, seriously, &#8220;that, dissatisfied with basketball
and the like, the girls will become baseball
and football&mdash;what do you call them, Chetwood?
Fans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right, mother,&#8221; Laura hastened to answer
instead of her brother. &#8220;And all we girls
of Central High are fans already when it comes to
baseball and football. I&#8217;d like to belong to a baseball
team, myself, for one&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura!&#8221; gasped her mother, while her father
and Chet burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the finest game in the world,&#8221; declared
Laura, stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! hear!&#8221; from Chet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to see the games a lot with father
Saturday afternoons,&#8221; began Laura, when her
mother interposed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed? <i>That</i> is why you are so eager always
to spend your forenoons with your father
on Saturday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother! I really <i>do</i> help father in the
jewelry-store&mdash;don&#8217;t I, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t get along without you, daughter,&#8221;
said Mr. Belding, stoutly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And he always takes me for a nice bite in a
restaurant,&#8221; pursued the girl, &#8220;and then if
there&#8217;s a game, we go to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Runaways!&#8221; said Mrs. Belding, shaking an
admonishing finger at them. &#8220;So you encourage
her in these escapades, do you, Mr. Belding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so, Mother,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;You&#8217;re
behind the times. Girls are different nowadays&mdash;in
open practise, at least&mdash;from what they
were in our day. Of course, I remember when
I first saw you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Belding,
flushing very prettily, while the children laughed.
&#8220;We will not rake up old stories, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any reference to the occasion at which her
husband hinted, usually brought his wife &#8220;to
time,&#8221; as Chet slangily expressed it. She agreed
to be present at the girls&#8217; gymnasium on that
last day when the girls used the paraphernalia
as they pleased, with Mrs. Case standing by to
direct, or admonish, or advise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Belding found in the gallery overlooking
the big gymnasium floor many of her neighbors,
church friends, or fellow club-members.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to get here for months,&#8221; one
stout lady confided to the Market Street jeweler&#8217;s
wife; &#8220;but it does seem to me I never have a
minute to spare. But Lluella says that I <i>must</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
come now, for the term is ending. That&#8217;s Lluella
over yonder jumping on that mat. Isn&#8217;t she
quick on her feet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grace is such a reckless child,&#8221; complained
the lady on Mrs. Belding&#8217;s other side. &#8220;She&#8217;s
her father all over again&mdash;and he&#8217;s got the
quickest temper of any man I ever saw. Gets
over it right away, you know; but it&#8217;s a trial to
have a man get mad because the coffee&#8217;s muddy
of a morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know all about <i>that</i>,&#8221; sighed the fleshy
lady, windily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;s really any danger of
the children getting hurt here, Mrs. Belding?&#8221;
proceeded the thin mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe not. Laura says there is no
danger&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, your Laura is a regular athlete!&#8221; interrupted
the fat woman. &#8220;My Lluella says she
is just <i>wonderful</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So does my Grace,&#8221; declared the thin lady
on the other side. &#8220;She says there&#8217;s nobody like
&#8216;Mother Wit,&#8217; as she calls Laura.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is no danger,&#8221; murmured Mrs.
Belding, not sure whether she was glad or sorry
that her daughter was so popular.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Belding! are <i>you</i> here?&#8221; broke in
rather a shrill voice from the rear. &#8220;I told Lily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
I would come to-day; but really, I hardly knew
whether it was the thing to approve of this
gymnasium business&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pendleton&#8217;s voice trailed off as it usually
did before she completed a sentence. She was
a small, extremely vivacious, black-eyed woman,
much overdressed, and carrying a lorgnette with
which she eyed the crowd of girlish figures on
the floor below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she murmured to Mrs. Belding,
&#8220;if <i>you</i> approve&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Grace now?&#8221; cried the thin lady,
suddenly. &#8220;Mercy! See where she has climbed
to. Do you suppose they can get her without a
ladder?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace, a thin, wiry child of the wriggling type,
had successfully clambered up the rope almost to
the beam overhead and was now surveying the
gallery with lofty compassion, which included a
lively appreciation of her mother&#8217;s uneasiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Grace!&#8221; shrilled the thin woman. &#8220;Get
down this instant! Or do you want me to bring
you a ladder?&#8221;</p>
<p>An appreciative giggle arose from some of the
girls below. Grace turned rather red around her
ears, and began to descend. It was one thing to
make her mother marvel; she did not want her
&#8220;act&#8221; to be turned to ridicule.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They look real pretty&mdash;now don&#8217;t they?&#8221;
admitted Mrs. Pendleton, loftily, after surveying
the gymnasium for some time through her
lorgnette. &#8220;Lily&#8217;s dress cost us a deal of trouble.
But she looks well in it. She&#8217;s well developed
for her age and&mdash;thank goodness!&mdash;she has a
<i>chic</i> way with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought we never would get the suit to fit
her. And she changed her shoes three times,&#8221;
added the society matron. &#8220;Finally I told her
if she was going to have nervous prostration getting
ready to take physical culture, she&#8217;d better
wait and take it when she was convalescent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Lluella will be careful of her hands,&#8221;
said the fleshy lady on Mrs. Belding&#8217;s right.
&#8220;She&#8217;s always bruising or cutting her fingers.
Just like her aunt. Her aunt always had to wear
gloves doing her housework.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There! they are going to march,&#8221; cried the
thin lady, as Mrs. Case blew her whistle and the
girl on the rope slid the last few feet to the floor.
&#8220;Grace is down, thank goodness!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her music teacher says Grace&#8217;s ear is a regular
gift&mdash;she keeps such good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure no sensible parent would ever have
<i>bought</i> those ears,&#8221; whispered Mrs. Pendleton
to Mrs. Belding. &#8220;They must have been a gift,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
for those organs on the agile Grace were painfully
prominent.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she had <i>such</i> a pretty smile when she
looked up at her mother just now,&#8221; whispered the
kind-hearted Mrs. Belding.</p>
<p>&#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; said the society matron&mdash;though
why it should have reminded her nobody
knows! &#8220;That reminds me, my Lily is crazy to
go camping&mdash;positively crazy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; sighed Mrs. Belding. &#8220;Laura is
determined, too. And her father approves and
has overruled all <i>my</i> objections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not that with me at all,&#8221; said Mrs.
Pendleton, briskly. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad enough to have
the child go. She&#8217;s too much advanced for her
age, anyway. If she spends this summer at Newport,
and Bar Harbor, and one or two other
places where I positively <i>must</i> appear, I&#8217;ll never
be able to get her back into school this fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ages a mother so to have a growing daughter&mdash;and
one that is so forward as Lily,&#8221; said
this selfish lady, fretfully. &#8220;Lily thinks she is
grown up now. No. I approve of her going
with a lot of little girls into camp. And she wants
to go with your Laura&#8217;s crowd, Mrs. Belding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure&mdash;Laura would be pleased,&#8221; said
Mrs Belding, sweetly, without an idea that she
was laying up trouble in store for Mother Wit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then, I can leave it with you, dear Mrs.
Belding?&#8221; cried Mrs. Pendleton, with uncanny
eagerness. &#8220;You will arrange it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I presume Laura and her friends
would have no objection to another of their
schoolmates joining them. I understand Mrs.
Morse will chaperon them&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And quite a proper person for that office,
too,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Pendleton. &#8220;I presume they
will take along a maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I do not know,&#8221; said Mrs. Belding,
beginning to feel somewhat worried now. &#8220;I
imagine the girls expect to do for themselves&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I will send a maid with Lily. At least, I
will pay the wages of one who will do for all the
girls&mdash;in a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She bustled away to find Lily after the march.
Mrs. Belding waited for her daughter in more or
less trepidation. It had suddenly crossed her
mind that Lily Pendleton was seldom at her house
with the friends that Mother Wit gathered about
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;LONESOME LIZ&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, galloping grasshoppers!&#8221; gasped Bobby
Hargrew, clinging tight to Laura and Nellie
Agnew in the dressing-room. &#8220;Do you hear
what she says?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What language, Bob!&#8221; said Nellie, in horror.
&#8220;How <i>can</i> you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of whom are you speaking?&#8221; asked Laura,
with an admonishing look.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Lil Pendleton. The gall of her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, Bob!&#8221; commanded Laura. &#8220;You talk
like a street urchin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if I talk like a sea urchin,&#8221; complained
the smaller girl. &#8220;She says she&#8217;s going
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Nell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Camping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; exclaimed Laura, promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Pendleton girl. Says her mother just
told her. <i>Your</i> mother said so, Laura Belding.
So there!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to complain of your mother,
Laura,&#8221; said the grocer&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;but it seems
too bad we can&#8217;t pick and choose whom we&#8217;ll have
go camping in our crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother doesn&#8217;t understand! I am sure she
never meant to <i>make</i> us take Lil if we didn&#8217;t want
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And surely we <i>don&#8217;t</i>,&#8221; declared the doctor&#8217;s
daughter, with more emphasis than she usually
used in commenting upon any subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put the rollers under her and let her zip,&#8221;
exclaimed the slangy Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Gee Gee should hear you,&#8221; laughed Laura,
referring to one of the very strict lady teachers of
Central High, Miss Grace Gee Carrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s too busy with Margit Salgo&mdash;Beg pardon!&#8221;
exclaimed Bobby. &#8220;Margaret Carrington,
as she will in future be known. Gee Gee has
scarcely called me down this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if it was Margit who wanted to go,&#8221;
sighed Nell Agnew, speaking of the half-Gypsy
girl who had just come under the care of Miss
Carrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or Eve Sitz,&#8221; added Bobby. &#8220;But Eve says
she gets out-of-door work enough on the farm in
the summer. Camping out is no fun for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say about Lily,&#8221; began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
Laura. &#8220;I cannot understand mother promising
such a thing. If anybody should decide, it should
be Jess&#8217; mother. <i>She</i> is going with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! there&#8217;s another thing,&#8221; interrupted the
fly-away Bobby. &#8220;If Lil goes, she&#8217;s going to
take along a lady&#8217;s maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What</i>?&#8221; gasped the other girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Pendleton is going to pay the wages of
a girl to go with us and do the camp work,&#8221; announced
Bobby, and now she spoke with some
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; exclaimed Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so bad,&#8221; sighed Nellie, who really did
<i>not</i> like hard work and had dreaded that division
of labor which she knew must fall to her if they
went camping without &#8220;help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a girl along to cook and do up the
beds and wash dishes and the like wouldn&#8217;t be so
bad,&#8221; announced Bobby, growing braver as Nell
seemed to encourage the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Miss Hargrew!&#8221; accused Laura. &#8220;I
believe you have gone over to the enemy. <i>You</i>
really want Lil to go with us to Acorn Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But I&#8217;d be glad to have her mother pay
the wages of somebody to do most of the hard
work,&#8221; grinned Bobby.</p>
<p>There was a regular &#8220;buzz society,&#8221; as Bobby
called it, after the girls were dressed. The original
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
six who had planned to go camping on Acorn
Island <i>did</i> hum like a colony of bees when they
all learned that Lily Pendleton was likely to be
foisted upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame!&#8221; exclaimed Jess, angrily.
&#8220;She knows well enough we don&#8217;t want her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; murmured one of the Lockwood twins.
&#8220;She asked us and we said the invitation would
have to come through Laura.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cowards!&#8221; exclaimed Mother Wit, dramatically.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why she got her mother to go
to <i>mine</i>. And I am real angry with mother&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Laura! we wouldn&#8217;t offend your mother
for anything,&#8221; said Nell, hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or put her in an uncomfortable position,&#8221;
Bobby added. &#8220;She&#8217;s been too nice to us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, of course, we have to stand Lil in the
school and gymnasium. She won&#8217;t kill us; she&#8217;s
only silly,&#8221; went on Nell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re all more or less willing to
have Lil go,&#8221; declared Laura, in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We-ell,&#8221; drawled Bobby. &#8220;There&#8217;s the
chance of having somebody to do the camp work
for us&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Lil!&#8221; shrieked Jess. &#8220;She never lifts
her hand at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nell. &#8220;But Mrs. Pendleton will
pay a maid&#8217;s wages.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;ha!&#8221; ejaculated Jess Morse. &#8220;I smell
a mice, as the Dutchman says. We are to be
bribed.&#8221;</p>
<p>And bribed they were. At least, none of them
wished to put Laura&#8217;s mother to any trouble. So
they agreed to let Lily Pendleton go camping with
them. Mrs. Pendleton left it to the girls to find
anyone they wanted to help about the camp, and
promised to pay good wages.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know just whom we can get,&#8221; Bobby said,
eagerly, that evening when the girls&mdash;and some
of the boys&mdash;were assembled as usual on the
Belding front porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That Bean girl,&#8221; said the groceryman&#8217;s
daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s she? Miss Boston Bean?&#8221; chuckled
Chet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lizzie Bean! I know who she is,&#8221; exclaimed
Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the girl who&#8217;s been helping the Longs
since Alice came back to school. Now Alice will
keep house for her father and the other children
again, and Lizzie will be out of a job,&#8221; explained
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew! &#8216;Lonesome Liz?&#8217;&#8221; ejaculated
Lance Darby. &#8220;Short and Long calls her that.
Says she&#8217;s about half cracked&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess she isn&#8217;t cracked enough to hurt,&#8221; said
Dora Lockwood, quickly. &#8220;Is she, Dorothy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; agreed her twin. &#8220;And she
keeps the house beautifully clean, and looks after
Tommy fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you Master Tommy Long is some
kid to look after,&#8221; chuckled Chet.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s no dream,&#8221; agreed his chum,
Lance.</p>
<p>Bobby began to laugh, too. &#8220;Did you hear his
latest?&#8221; she demanded of the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s latest,&#8221; asked Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tommy Long&mdash;the infant terrible?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear it, Bobs,&#8221; said Jess. &#8220;If he can
say anything worse than <i>you</i> can&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this break on Master Tommy&#8217;s part
was entirely unintentional. Alice was telling me
about it. She sends him to Sunday School and
he has to memorize the Golden Text and repeat it
to her when he comes home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other Sunday he had been skylarking in
Sunday School, it was evident, for when she
asked him to tell her the text, he shot this one at
her: &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry. You&#8217;ll get the blanket.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What</i>?&#8221; gasped Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a teaser,&#8221; said Lance. &#8220;What did the
kid mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what troubled Alice,&#8221; chuckled Bobby.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
&#8220;She couldn&#8217;t get it at all; but Tommy stuck to
it that he had given her the text straight. So she
looked it up herself and what do you suppose
Tommy had twisted into &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry. You&#8217;ll
get the blanket?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up,&#8221; said Jess. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the text was,&#8221; said Bobby, more seriously,
&#8220;&#8216;Fear not; the Comforter shall come
unto you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That kid is a terror,&#8221; said Chet, when the
laugh had subsided. &#8220;And so&#8217;s Short and Long.
I believe he agreed to let Pretty Sweet go along
with us to Lake Dunkirk just because he likes to
play jokes on Purt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; sighed Bobby, with unction.
&#8220;With Pretty in your camp and Lil in ours, the
sun of no day should go down upon us without,
seeing <i>some</i> fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you have &#8216;Lonesome Liz&#8217; along,&#8221;
chuckled Lance, &#8220;you girls certainly won&#8217;t forget
how to laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was agreed that Laura and Jess should see
Lizzie Bean the next morning and engage her for
the position&mdash;if she would accept. They started
early, for although they were only juniors and
would have another year to attend Central High
before graduation, this last day of school would
be a busy one for them as well as for the graduating
class.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>Billy and Alice Long, who were their schoolmates,
lived in a much poorer quarter of the town;
it was down toward the wharves, and not far
from the Central High&#8217;s boathouses.</p>
<p>The street was a typical water-side street, with
small, gaily painted cottages, or cottages without
any paint at all save that put on lavishly by the
ancient decorating firm of Wind &amp; Weather.
Each dwelling had its own tiny fenced yard, with
a garden behind. The Longs&#8217; was neatly kept
both front and rear, and the house itself showed
no neglect by the tenants.</p>
<p>Mr. Long was a hard working man, and although
the children were motherless, Alice, the
oldest, kept the home neat and cheerful for her
brothers and sisters. All the children were old
enough to go to school save Tommy; and he had
been to kindergarten occasionally this last term
and would go to school regularly in the fall.</p>
<p>Laura and Jess, hurrying on their errand, came
in sight of the Long cottage abruptly, and of a
wobegone little figure on the front step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Tommy!&#8221; exclaimed Laura Belding.
&#8220;Whatever is the the matter, Tommy?&#8221; for
the little fellow was crying softly.</p>
<p>He was a most cherubic looking child, with a
pink and white face, yellow curls that swept the
clean collar of his shirt-waist, and a plump, &#8220;hug-able&#8221;
little body.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what <i>is</i> the matter, dear?&#8221; begged Jess
Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;H-he&#8217;s gone an&#8217; cut off th-the tails of the
pu-puppies,&#8221; sobbed Master Tommy, his breast
heaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who has?&#8221; demanded Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;He. That man what co-comed here,&#8221; choked
the little fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pity! I&#8217;m awfully sorry,&#8221; Laura pursued,
soothingly. &#8220;The poor little puppies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-yes. Pa s-said <i>I</i> should chop &#8217;em off
myself!&#8221; concluded Master Tommy in a burst of
anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness me!&#8221; gasped Jess, horror-stricken.
&#8220;Will you hear that boy talk? He&#8217;s a
perfect little savage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mother Wit, shaking her
head. &#8220;He&#8217;s only a boy&mdash;that&#8217;s all. You never
had a brother, Jess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know well enough Chet was never like <i>that</i>,&#8221;
declared Josephine, confidently.</p>
<p>They went in by the front gate and walked
around the house, leaving the disappointed youngster
wiping his eyes. They expected to find Lizzie
Bean at the back.</p>
<p>In that they were not mistaken. At the well-curb
was a lank, bony girl, who might have been
Laura&#8217;s age, or perhaps a couple of years older.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
She was dreadfully thin. As she hauled on the
chain which brought the brimming bucket to the
top of the well, she betrayed more red elbow and
more white stockinged ankle-bone than any <i>one</i>
person should display.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness, she&#8217;s thin!&#8221; whispered Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not looking for a Hebe to help us at
the camp,&#8221; Laura returned in the same low tone.</p>
<p>Lizzie Bean turned to see who was approaching.
Her face was as thin as the rest of her figure.
Prominent cheek bones, a sharp, long nose,
and a pointed chin do not make a beautiful countenance,
to say the least.</p>
<p>Besides, the expression of her face was lachrymose
in the extreme. It did seem, as Jess afterward
said, that Lizzie must have lost all her relatives
and friends very recently, and was mourning
for them all!</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me!&#8221; she whispered to Laura.
&#8220;No wonder they call her &#8216;Lonesome Liz.&#8217;
She&#8217;s so sad looking she&#8217;s positively funny.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE START</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;What do you girls want?&#8221; drawled the
lean girl, resting her red elbows on the well-shelf
and looking down at Laura and Jess Morse.</p>
<p>She did not speak unpleasantly; but she was
very abrupt. Laura saw that Lizzie Bean&#8217;s flat,
shallow appearing eyes were of a greenish gray
color&mdash;eyes in which a twinkle could not possibly
lurk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand that you are not going to
help Alice much longer,&#8221; Laura said, pleasantly.
&#8220;So we have come to see if you would like another
position for a few weeks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean&mdash;a <i>job</i>?&#8221; proposed Liz-Bean,
bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-yes,&#8221; said Laura, rather taken aback.</p>
<p>&#8220;What doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we girls are going camping. There
are seven of us&mdash;and Mrs. Morse. Mrs. Morse
is the mother of my friend, here, Josephine
Morse&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please ter meet yer,&#8221; interposed Liz, bobbing
a little courtesy at the much amused Jess.</p>
<p>Laura went on steadily, and without smiling
too broadly at Liz:</p>
<p>&#8220;There are seven of us girls and Mrs. Morse.
We shall live very simply&mdash;in tents and in a
cabin, on Acorn Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight in fam&#8217;bly, eh?&#8221; put in the thin girl.
&#8220;Eight is a bigger contract than I got here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! in camping out we don&#8217;t expect anything
fancy,&#8221; Laura hastened to say. &#8220;We want
somebody to make beds, and wash dishes, and
clean up generally. Of course, the cooking will
not <i>all</i> fall on your shoulders&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sh&#8217;d hope not,&#8221; said Liz, briskly. &#8220;Not if
it was as solid as some folkses&#8217; biscuits. One woman
I worked for once made her soda-riz biscuits
so solid that if a panful had fell on yer
shoulders &#8217;twould ha&#8217; broke yer back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jess <i>had</i> to explode at that, but the odd girl
did not even smile. She only stared at the giggling
Jess and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t ye well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; gasped Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; drawled Liz. &#8220;My
a&#8217;nt what brought me up useter keep a bottle of
giggle medicine for us gals. An&#8217; it was nasty
tastin&#8217; stuff, too. She made us take a gre&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
spoonful if we laffed at table, or after we gotter
bed nights. There was jala inter it, I b&#8217;lieve. I
guess I could make ye some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jess stopped laughing in a hurry. Laura tried
to ignore her chum&#8217;s indignant look; but it was
quite plain that Lizzie Bean &#8220;had all her wits
about her,&#8221; as the saying is.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can cook?&#8221; Laura observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can boil water without burnin&#8217; it,&#8221;
declared the odd girl. &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t no Woodruff-Wisteria
chef.&#8221; Afterward the chums
figured it out that Liz meant &#8220;Waldorf-Astoria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you would like to go with us?&#8221;
Laura asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno yet. Where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura explained more fully about the camping
site, how they were to get there, and other particulars
of the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;It listens good,&#8221; Liz said, reflectively.
&#8220;Though I ain&#8217;t never cooked nothin&#8217; but soft-soap
over a campfire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! there will be a portable stove,&#8221; Laura
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When ye goin&#8217;?&#8221; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll ye pay?&#8221; was the next bluntly put
question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Laura told her the weekly wage Mrs. Pendleton
had guaranteed. Although Lizzie Bean&#8217;s
face was well nigh expressionless at all times, the
girls saw at once that something was wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; said Liz, slowly. &#8220;I have worked
mighty cheap in my life&mdash;and I ain&#8217;t got no job
when I leave here&mdash;an&#8217; I gotter eat. But that
<i>does</i> seem a <i>naw</i>-ful little wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! I think that is real liberal,&#8221; declared
Jess, with some warmth.</p>
<p>Liz eyed her again coldly. &#8220;You must ha&#8217;
worked awful cheap in your life,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Laura explained, quietly, laying
an admonitory hand upon her chum&#8217;s arm,
&#8220;You know, that is what you will receive each
week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s <i>that</i>?&#8221; demanded Liz, with a jump,
&#8220;Say that again, will ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will pay you that sum weekly,&#8221; repeated
Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say&mdash;say it by the month!&#8221; gasped the lean
girl, her eyes showing more surprise than Laura
had thought them capable of betraying.</p>
<p>Laura did as she was requested. A slow,
faint grin dawned on Liz Bean&#8217;s narrow countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I been useter gittin&#8217; paid by the month&mdash;and
sometimes not <i>then</i>. Some ladies has paid me so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
little for helpin&#8217; them that I wisht they&#8217;d paid me
only every <i>three</i> months, so&#8217;s &#8217;twould sound bigger!</p>
<p>&#8220;I gotter take ye up before somebody pinches
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinches you? What do you mean?&#8221; asked
Jess, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to wake up,&#8221; declared Liz. &#8220;I
never got so much money since I was turned
adrift when my a&#8217;nt died. Don&#8217;t <i>you</i> wake up,
neither, and forgit to pay me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise not to do that,&#8221; laughed Laura.
&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll come with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t break an arm,&#8221; declared Lizzie
Bean, with emphasis.</p>
<p>They told her how to meet them at the dock,
and the hour they expected to start. &#8220;And
bring your oldest clothes,&#8221; warned Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Liz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just about live in old clothes&mdash;or in a
bathing suit&mdash;in camp,&#8221; explained Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your heart!&#8221; exclaimed Liz. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
never had nothin&#8217; but old clo&#8217;es. Been wearin&#8217;
hand-me-downs ever since I can remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness gracious!&#8221; said Jess, and she
and Laura hurried off for school. &#8220;Did you
ever see such an uncouth creature? I don&#8217;t wonder
Billy Long says she&#8217;s cracked.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about her being cracked, as you
call it,&#8221; laughed Laura. &#8220;Just because she&#8217;s
queer is no proof that she is an imbecile. You
know the old parody on &#8216;Lives of Great Men
All Remind Us,&#8217; don&#8217;t you?&#8221; and she went on to
quote:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;&#8216;Lives of imbeciles remind us<br />
It may some day come to pass,<br />
We shall see one staring at us<br />
From our trusty looking-glass!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; responded Jess. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get to be
as bad as Bobby Hargrew with those old wheezes.
But, did you <i>ever</i> see such a girl before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Laura. &#8220;I honestly never
did. But I am quite sure she is in the possession
of all her senses&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She may be; but I bet her senses are not like
other folks&#8217;,&#8221; chuckled Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;She surely won&#8217;t <i>bite</i>, Jess,&#8221; responded
Laura, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope not! &#8216;Boil water without burning
it!&#8217; What do you know about <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s funny,&#8221; said Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! I only hope we get something to eat
in camp,&#8221; murmured Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t expect her to do all the cooking,&#8221;
Laura said. &#8220;And I shall tell the girls so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! I don&#8217;t know whether I want to
go camping with this bunch, after all,&#8221; said
Jess. &#8220;What some of them will do to the victuals
they have to cook will be a shame!&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the prospect of indifferent cookery
made none of the girls of Central High less enthusiastic
in the matter of the preparations for
camping out on Acorn Island, in the middle of
Lake Dunkirk.</p>
<p>They were all as busy as bees the next day,
packing their bags and flying about from house to
house, asking each other: &#8220;What you going to
take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me!&#8221; cried Laura, at last; &#8220;it
isn&#8217;t what do we <i>want</i>, but how little can we get
along with! Discard everything possible, girls&mdash;do!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby Hargrew declared Lil Pendleton had
started to pack a Saratoga trunk, and that she
had been obliged to point out to Lil that neither
of the motorboats was large enough to ship
such a piece of baggage.</p>
<p>Their gymnasium suits would be just the thing
in camp. And of course they all had bathing
suits. Otherwise most of the girls got their
apparel down to what Jess Morse called &#8220;an insignificant
minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the King of India, or the Duke and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Duchess of Doosenberry, comes calling at our
camp, we shall have to put up a scarlet fever sign
and all go to bed,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have
nothing to receive them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not Purt Sweet,&#8221; chuckled Billy Long.
&#8220;Purt&#8217;s packed a dinner jacket and a pair of
spats. How much other fancy raiment he proposes
to spring on us the deponent knoweth not.
He&#8217;ll be just a scream in the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked me if there were many dangerous
characters lurking in the woods around Lake
Dunkirk,&#8221; chuckled Lance. &#8220;Somebody has
been stringing him about outlaws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Short and Long looks guilty,&#8221; said Chet,
suspiciously. &#8220;What you been stuffin&#8217; Purt with,
Billy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy Long, who straddled the piazza rail,
swinging his feet, showed his teeth in a broad
smile. &#8220;You read about that Halliday fellow,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! the chap they say stole the money from
that Albany bank?&#8221; responded Lance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was securities he stole&mdash;and forged people&#8217;s
names to them so as to get money,&#8221; said
Laura. &#8220;The Lockwood girls&#8217; Aunt Dora lost
some money by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is&mdash;if he did it,&#8221; said Chet, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the newspapers say so,&#8221; Jess observed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What if they do?&#8221; demanded Billy, belligerently.
&#8220;They all said <i>I</i> helped burglarize that
department store last summer&mdash;didn&#8217;t they?
And I never did it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It was another monkey,&#8221; chuckled
Lance.</p>
<p>The others laughed, for Billy Long had gotten
them into serious trouble on the occasion mentioned,
and it was long enough in the past now
to seem amusing. But Chet added:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder to me that Norman Halliday
had a chance to get hold of all those securities
and forge people&#8217;s names to them. And he knew
just which papers to take. Looks fishy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he ran away, anyhow,&#8221; Lance said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So did Billy,&#8221; Bobby said. &#8220;And for the
same reason, perhaps. He was scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father says,&#8221; Chet pursued, &#8220;he has his
doubts about Halliday&#8217;s guilt. He believes he is
a catspaw for somebody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;the papers say he&#8217;s
gone into the Big Woods south of Lake Dunkirk.
And Purt wants to carry a gun to defend himself
from outlaws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he does,&#8221; Chet said, seriously, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see
that there are no cartridges in the gun. Huh!
I wouldn&#8217;t trust Purt Sweet with a pop-gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby, meanwhile, was saying to Laura: &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
wonder why Old Dimple was interested enough in
that Albany bank robbery to carry around that
clipping out of the paper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he lost money, too,&#8221; Laura suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that about the old Prof?&#8221; put in
Chet. &#8220;Do you know he&#8217;s gone out of town
already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; was the chorus in reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fact. I saw him with his suitcase this forenoon.
He took the boat to Lumberport.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as we shall all start in that same direction
to-morrow morning, bright and early&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all of us bright, but presumably early,&#8221;
put in Bobby, sotto voce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, it&#8217;s time we were in bed,&#8221; finished
Mother Wit. &#8220;Off with you all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether Laura&#8217;s advice had a good effect, or
not, nobody was really late at the rendezvous
the next morning. Prettyman Sweet&#8217;s motorboat
<i>Duchess</i>, a very nice craft, and the larger powerboat
belonging to Chet Belding and Lance Darby,
named <i>Bonnie Lass</i>, were manned by the boys
before the girls appeared.</p>
<p>These two boats were large enough to transport
both parties of campers, and would likewise
tow the flotilla of canoes. The <i>Duchess</i>
tailed behind it three double canoes belonging to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
the girls and the <i>Bonnie Lass</i> towed five belonging
to their boy friends.</p>
<p>It was a fine day and the lake was as blue as
the sky&mdash;and almost as smooth to look upon.
A party of parents and friends came to see the
campers start. The girls and Mrs. Morse went
aboard the <i>Bonnie Lass</i>. Lizzie Bean, with a
bulging old-fashioned carpet-bag, appeared in
season and joined the girls.</p>
<p>In the bustle of departure not many noticed
the odd looking maid. The girls and boys were
too busy shouting goodbyes to those ashore, and
the crowd ashore was too busy shouting good
wishes, or last instructions, to the campers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pendleton had been driven down to the
wharf, early as the hour was, to see her daughter
off.</p>
<p>&#8220;And be sure to wear your rubbers if it rains,
Lily!&#8221; the lady shrieked after the departing
<i>Bonnie Lass</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; whispered Bobby, to Jess. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose
somebody&#8217;ll have to hold an umbrella over her,
too, if it starts to shower.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>PRETTYMAN SWEET MAKES A FRIEND</h3>
</div>
<p>Lake Luna was a beautiful body of water, all
of twenty miles long and half as broad, with
Centerport on its southern shore and Lumberport
and Keyport situated at either end.</p>
<p>The first named stood at the mouth of Rocky
River which fed the great lake, while Keyport
was at the head of Rolling River through which
Lake Luna discharged its waters.</p>
<p>Centerport was a thriving and rich city of some
150,000 inhabitants, while the other two towns&mdash;although
much smaller&mdash;were likewise thriving
business communities. There was considerable
traffic on Lake Luna, between the cities named,
and up and down the rivers.</p>
<p>Cavern Island was a beautiful resort in the
middle of Lake Luna; but man&#8217;s hand was shown
in its landscape gardening and in the pretty
buildings and the park at one end.</p>
<p>Acorn Island, in Lake Dunkirk (thirty miles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
above Lumberport, and connected with Lake Luna
by Rocky River) was a very different place.
It was heavily timbered and had been held by a
private estate for years. Therefore the trees and
rubbish had been allowed to grow, and one end of
the island, as the girls of Central High knew,
was almost a jungle.</p>
<p>But at the eastern end&mdash;that nearest the head
of Rocky River&mdash;was a pleasant grove on a high
knoll, where the old cabin stood. There they proposed
to camp.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Tom Hargrew, Bobby&#8217;s father,
had been kind enough to send the girls&#8217; tents up
to the island with the men he had directed to
repair the cabin, and the party expected to find
the camp pitched, and everything ready for them
when they arrived at Acorn Island.</p>
<p>This would scarcely be before dark, for there
was some current to Rocky River, although its
channel was deep and there were no bridges or
other barriers which the powerboats and their
tows could not easily pass.</p>
<p>The boys expected to have to rough it at the
site of <i>their</i> camp for the first night, and they had
come prepared for all emergencies of wind and
weather.</p>
<p>All, did we say? All but one!</p>
<p>In the confusion of getting under way the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
details of Prettyman Sweet&#8217;s outing suit, and his
general get-up for camping in the wilds, was
scarcely noticed. Once the boats were steering
up the lake toward Lumberport, a sudden shriek
from Billy Long drew the attention of the girls
and Mrs. Morse to the object to which he pointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not! it&#8217;s not! my eyes deceive me!&#8221;
panted Short and Long, who was the third
member of the crew of boys aboard the <i>Bonnie Lass</i>,
Chet and Lance being the other two.</p>
<p>Short and Long was pointing to the other
powerboat that was drawing in beside the <i>Bonnie Lass</i>,
Pretty himself was at the wheel of the
<i>Duchess</i> for he had learned to manage her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter with you, Billy?&#8221; Chet
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> it I see?&#8221; begged the younger boy,
wringing his hands and glaring across the short
strip of water between the powerboats. &#8220;I know
there ain&#8217;t no sech animile, as the farmer said
when he first saw the giraffe at the circus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s eating you, Billy?&#8221; asked Lance,
who was giving his attention to the steering of
the <i>Bonnie Lass</i>. &#8220;Don&#8217;t frighten the girls and
Mrs. Morse to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just some joke of Billy&#8217;s,&#8221; began Jess,
when the very short boy broke in with:</p>
<p>&#8220;If <i>that&#8217;s</i> a joke, may I never see another!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
It is a phantom! It&#8217;s a nightmare! It&#8217;s something
that comes to you in a bad dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; demanded Chet, suddenly shaking
Short and Long by the collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Chetwood,&#8221; begged Billy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
strong. I&#8217;m sea-sick. That thing yonder has
queered me&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What thing?&#8221; asked Laura. &#8220;We don&#8217;t see
the joke, Billy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go again&mdash;calling a serious thing
like that a joke,&#8221; cried the small boy. &#8220;Look at
it&mdash;at the wheel of the <i>Duchess</i>! How ever did
it crawl aboard? I bet a cent it&#8217;s been living
in the bottom of the lake for years and years,
and has come up to the light of day for the first
time now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ridiculous thing!&#8221; snapped Lily Pendleton.
&#8220;Do you mean Prettyman Sweet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness gracious Agnes!&#8221; gasped Billy.
&#8220;That&#8217;s never Purt Sweet? <i>Don&#8217;t</i> tell me he&#8217;s
disguised himself for a nigger minstrel show in
that fashion?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were all laughing at the unconscious Purt
by now&mdash;all save Lily; and Chet said, gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something the matter with your
eyesight, Short and Long. That&#8217;s Purt in a brand
new outing suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t dress like that to go camping?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
murmured Billy. &#8220;Say not so! Somebody
dared him to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a fact that the exquisite of Central
High had decked himself out in most astonishing
array&mdash;considering that he was expected to
&#8220;rough it&#8221; in the woods instead of appear at a
lawn party on the &#8220;Hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His tailor put him up to that suit,&#8221; chuckled
Lance. &#8220;He told me so. As he expects to live
in the sylvan forest, as did the &#8216;merrie, merrie
men&#8217; of Robin Hood, Purt is dolled up accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; breathed Bobby. &#8220;Do you suppose
Robin Hood ever looked like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Lincoln green,&#8221; announced Lance, trying
to keep his face straight. &#8220;You notice that
the pants are short&mdash;knickerbockers, in fact.
They are tied just below the knee with &#8216;ribbands&#8217;
in approved outlaw style.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my!&#8221; giggled Dora Lockwood. &#8220;Do
you suppose they hurt him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What hurts him most is the leather belt at
which is slung a long-bladed hunting knife so dull
that it wouldn&#8217;t cut cheese! But the knife handle
gets in his way every time he stoops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! he&#8217;s so funny!&#8221; gasped Dorothy Lockwood.
&#8220;You boys are certainly going to have a
great time with Pretty Sweet on this trip.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it is funny at all,&#8221; muttered
Lily Pendleton. &#8220;That rude little thing, Billy
Long, tries to be too smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look at the cap!&#8221; gasped Laura, who
was herself too much amused to ignore the queer
get-up of their classmate. &#8220;Where did he get
the idea of <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tam-o&#8217;-shanter,&#8221; said Lance. &#8220;Another
idea of the tailor&#8217;s. That tailor, I think, tries
things out on Pretty. If Pretty doesn&#8217;t get shot
wearing them, then he puts similar garments on
his dummies and risks them outside his shop
door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what has he got stuck into the cap?&#8221;
pursued Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;A feather. Rather, the remains of one,&#8221;
chuckled Lance. &#8220;It was quite a long one when
he started for the dock this morning; but he
crossed the street right under the noses of Si
Cumming&#8217;s team of mules that draws the ice-wagon,
and that off mule grabbed the best part
of the feather. You know, that mule will eat
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, one thing is sure,&#8221; drawled Bobby.
&#8220;If Purt is supposed to represent a Sherwood
Forest outlaw, and he ever meets one of the outlaws
of the Big Woods that he&#8217;s been worried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
about, the latter &#8216;squashbuckler&#8217; will be scared
to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Squashbuckler&#8217; is good!&#8221; chuckled Jess.
&#8220;Some of those old villains I expect <i>were</i>
squashes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear!&#8221; ejaculated her mother. &#8220;I fear
the language you young folk use does not speak
well for your instructors of Central High.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we do not cast much glory upon our
teachers, Mrs. Morse,&#8221; rejoined Laura, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only Short and Long, here, who &#8216;does
the teachers proud,&#8217;&#8221; said her brother, with a
grin. &#8220;Hear about what he got off in Ancient
History class the other day? Professor Dimp
pretty nearly set him back for <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw&mdash;now,&#8221; growled Billy. &#8220;He asked for
a date, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the burn?&#8221; demanded Bobby, briskly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Old Dimple asked Billy to mention a
memorable date in Roman history, and Billy says:
&#8216;Antony&#8217;s with Cleopatra.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; gasped Jess. &#8220;That&#8217;s the worst
kind of slang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse paid the young folk very little
attention. She had withdrawn from the group
and was busy with pencil and notebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;When mother gets to work that way, she
heeds neither time, place, nor any passing event,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
laughed Jess. &#8220;She expects to sketch out her
whole book while she is at camp with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to be a dandy chaperone,&#8221; declared
Chet. &#8220;Suppose we&#8217;d had Miss Carrington
along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; groaned Bobby. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s
mention that lady again this summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we can cut out Old Dimple, too,&#8221;
grumbled Billy Long.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s off somewhere on a trip, so we won&#8217;t
have to bother about him,&#8221; said Chet, with confidence.</p>
<p>The girls had begun to compare notes regarding
what they had packed in their suitcases, long
before the boats reached Lumberport; and some
of them discovered that they had neglected to
bring some very essential things.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll just have to tie up beyond the Main
Street bridge, and give us a chance to shop, Chet,&#8221;
announced Laura. &#8220;We&#8217;re making good time as
it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just like a parcel of girls?&#8221; grumbled
Billy. &#8220;Now, we fellows didn&#8217;t forget a
thing&mdash;you bet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till we unpack at camp,&#8221; chuckled Chet.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He and Lance agreed to make the halt as the
girls requested; and they shouted to the crowd on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
the smaller boat to do the same. As Lily Pendleton
was one of the girls who must shop in Lumberton,
Purt Sweet was most willing to tarry and
accompany the girls ashore.</p>
<p>He was, in fact, the only escort the girls had
when they went up into the town in search of the
several articles they needed. The dude was evidently
proud of his outing suit and, as Billy
suggested, &#8220;wanted to give the people of Lumberport
a treat.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he swaggered along up Main Street with
the girls. Not a block from the wharf at
which the boats were tied he met with an adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever impression Purt is making on the
good people of this town,&#8221; whispered Nellie
Agnew to Laura, &#8220;he has certainly smitten a
four-footed inhabitant with a deep, deep interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Laura, turning swiftly
to see. Bobby Hargrew looked, likewise. Purt
and Lily were behind, and Bobby immediately
shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Purt who&#8217;s your friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Miss Hargrew?&#8221; asked Purt
staring. &#8220;I weally don&#8217;t get you&mdash;don&#8217;t you
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll get <i>you</i> in a minute,&#8221; chuckled
Bobby.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pay any attention to her, Mr. Sweet,&#8221;
said Lily. &#8220;She&#8217;s a vulgar little thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But just then Purt felt something at his heels
and turned swiftly. One of the homeliest mongrel
curs ever seen was sniffing at Purt&#8217;s green
stockings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out, you brute!&#8221; gasped the dude, rather
frightened.</p>
<p>But the dog didn&#8217;t seem to have any designs
upon Purt&#8217;s thin shanks. Instead, he jumped
about, foolishly stiff-legged as a dog will when he
thinks he has found a friend, and barked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! he&#8217;s glad to see you,&#8221; said Bobby.
&#8220;Where&#8217;d you find him, Purt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weally!&#8221; declared the dude, trying to shoo
the dog off. &#8220;I&mdash;I never did see the horrid brute
before&mdash;I never did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call him names. You&#8217;ll hurt his feelings,&#8221;
suggested one of the Lockwood twins,
while Laura said, seriously: &#8220;That dog certainly
does know you, Mr. Sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare, I never saw him before,&#8221; said Purt,
making frantic efforts to frighten the dog away.</p>
<p>He was a snarly haired dog, with one ear
cocked up and the other half chewed off, his coat
muddied, only half a tail, which he wiggled
ecstatically, and the most foolish looking face
that was ever given to a dog.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such a looking thing?&#8221;
gasped Bobby, half choked with laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how well he matches Purt&#8217;s suit,&#8221; said
Nellie, demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to walk with you if you don&#8217;t
get rid of that dog!&#8221; declared Lily, seeing that
many bystanders were laughing at the boy and
the mongrel.</p>
<p>She went ahead with the other girls while poor
Purt remained in the rear, trying his best to chase
away the friendly animal. But the more Purt
shooed him, or attempted to hit him, or strove
otherwise to send the brute about his business, the
more the latter considered that the boy was playing
with him, and he welcomed the game with
loud and cheerful barks.</p>
<p>Soon a small crowd was collected, watching the
performance with broad grins. The girls, giggling,
but rather worried by the attention that was
being attracted to their escort, darted into a store
and left Purt to settle the matter by himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE BARNACLE</h3>
</div>
<p>The crowd was laughing loudly and Purt
Sweet (although he was frequently the source
of mirth for his companions) did not enjoy it.
He began to hate that mongrel cur with an intense
hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away from me, you brute!&#8221; he exclaimed,
trying to kick the dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out there, son,&#8221; drawled one on-looker.
&#8220;If you abuse your dog the S. P. C. A. will do
something to you that you won&#8217;t like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t my dog! I weally never saw it before,&#8221;
gasped the dude, growing very warm and
red as the dog leaped about him in delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to tell that to the judge,&#8221; the man
assured him.</p>
<p>This really scared Purt. He did not want to
be arrested for abusing the strange dog. But he
could not allow it to follow him, that was sure.
The girls were already disgusted with him for
having attracted the brute.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I never meant to!&#8221; thought the boy, in
despair. &#8220;Oh! if I only had him out in the
woods, and had a good rock!&#8221;</p>
<p>But he dared not pelt the mongrel after what
the bystander had said. The crowd became so
numerous that a policeman came strolling that
way. He saw Purt with the dog dancing about
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! this is no place for a circus. You and
your dog get out!&#8221; commanded the officer of the
law. &#8220;Move on!&#8221;</p>
<p>He flourished his baton; the horrified Purt
made off around the nearest corner; the dog stuck
like a porous plaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I only had a club!&#8221; groaned Purt.</p>
<p>He escaped the crowd and sat down upon a
dwelling house stoop. At once that imbecile dog
rushed upon him, leaped into his lap, and lapped
Purt&#8217;s face!</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out! You nawsty, nawsty brute you!&#8221;
wailed the dude, beating the dog off weakly.</p>
<p>The latter considered it all in the game. He
had taken a decided liking to the boy from Central
High, and nothing would drive him away.</p>
<p>Purt had never really cared for dogs. Most
boys are tickled enough to get a dog&mdash;even a mongrel
like this one. But the dude found himself
with a possession for which he had never longed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>The dog lay down on the walk in front of him,
his tongue hanging on his breast like an inflammatory
necktie, and laughing as broadly as a dog
<i>could</i> laugh. He evidently admired Purt greatly.
Whether it was the Lincoln green suit, or the tam-o&#8217;-shanter
cap, or the dude&#8217;s personal pulchritude,
which most attracted his doggish soul, it was hard
to say.</p>
<p>Suddenly a window went up behind Purt and a
lady put out her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little boy! Little boy!&#8221; she called, shrilly.
&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d take your dog away from here. I
want to let my cat out, and dogs make her so
nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t my dog&mdash;weally it isn&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed
Purt, jumping up. Immediately the dog leaped
about, barking fit to split his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You naughty boy!&#8221; gasped the lady in the
window. &#8220;I have seen you with that dog go past
here hundreds of times!&#8221; and she immediately
slammed down the sash before Purt could further
defend himself.</p>
<p>However the lady could have made the mistake
of thinking she had seen Purt before, is not easily
explained. Perhaps she was very near sighted.</p>
<p>The Central High dude &#8220;moved on,&#8221; with the
mongrel frisking about him. Purt heartily wished
the animal would have a sunstroke (for it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
high noon now, and very warm) or would be
taken with an apoplectic stroke, or some other
sudden complaint!</p>
<p>Purt wanted to get back to Main Street and rejoin
the girls; but he knew it would be no use in
trying that unless he could &#8220;shake&#8221; the dog.
The girls (especially Lily Pendleton, whom he so
much admired) would not stand for that mongrel
brute following in their train.</p>
<p>So, finding that the dog was fastened to him
like a new Old Man of the Sea, Prettyman Sweet
decided to sneak back to the dock, by the way of
back streets, and escape the beast by going aboard
the <i>Duchess</i>.</p>
<p>He set off, therefore, through several byways,
coming out at last on a water-front street of more
prominence. Here were stores and tenements.
The gutters were crowded with noisy children,
and the street with traffic.</p>
<p>A fat butcher stood before his shop, with his
thumbs in the string of his apron. When he spied
Purt and his close companion, he gave vent to an
exclamation of satisfaction and reached for the
Central High boy with a mighty hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; he said, hoarsely, his fat face growing
scarlet on the instant. &#8220;I been waiting for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waiting for me, Mister?&#8221; gasped Purt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
&#8220;Weally&mdash;that cawn&#8217;t be, doncher know! I
never came this way before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ye smart Ike! But yer dog has,&#8221; growled
the man, giving Prettyman a shake that seemed
to start every tooth in his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me!&#8221; cried Purt. &#8220;I never saw
you before, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve seen yer dog&mdash;drat the beast! And
if I could ketch him I&#8217;d chop him up into sassingers&mdash;that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;d do to <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;he&#8217;s not my dog,&#8221; murmured Purt,
faintly.</p>
<p>Fido had scurried across the street when he
spied the butcher; but he waited there, mouth
agape, stump of tail wagging, and a knowing cock
to his good ear, to see how his adopted master
was coming out with his sworn enemy, the
butcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell yer what,&#8221; hoarsely said the butcher,
still gripping Purt&#8217;s shoulder, &#8220;a boy can deny
his own father, but &#8217;e can&#8217;t deny his dawg&mdash;no,
sir! That there brute knows ye, bub. Only yisterday
he grabbed several links of frankfurter
sassingers off&#8217;n this hook right overhead &#8217;ere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have no dumbed dawg like him
come an&#8217; grab my sassingers an&#8217; make off with
&#8217;em, free gratis for nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little crowd&mdash;little, but deeply interested&mdash;had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
gathered again. Had Purt been seeking notoriety
in Lumberport, he was getting it without
doubt!</p>
<p>The grocer next door, with a great guffaw of
laughter, cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Bill! don&#8217;t blame the dawg. He smelled
some o&#8217; his relatives, it&#8217;s likely, in the frankfurters,
an&#8217; set out to rescue &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do-ent care,&#8221; breathed the fat butcher,
growing more and more excited. &#8220;No man&#8217;s
dawg ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter do what he done ter me an&#8217;
git away with it. This boy has got ter pay for
what the dawg stole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Purt did not like to let go of money&mdash;among
his school chums he was considered a notorious
&#8220;tight-wad&#8221;&mdash;but he was willing to do almost
anything to get away from the greasy-handed
butcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what did the dog take? How much
were the frankfurters worth?&#8221; he stammered.
&#8220;The dog isn&#8217;t mine&mdash;weally!&mdash;but I&#8217;ll pay&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A dollar, then. And I&#8217;ll lose by it, too,&#8221; said
the butcher, but with an avaricious sparkle in his
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dollar&#8217;s worth of frankfurters!&#8221; gasped
Purt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. An&#8217; I wish they&#8217;d ha&#8217; chocked the
brute,&#8221; complained the butcher.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wish they had&mdash;before he ever saw me,&#8221;
murmured Purt.</p>
<p>He paid over the money and hurried away from
the laughing crowd. And there, within a block,
the dog was right at his heels again&mdash;rather slinkingly,
but with the joy of companionship in his
eye.</p>
<p>Now Purt was nearing the dock above the
Main Street bridge where the motorboats were
tied up. Whether the girls had returned or no,
he hated to face the other fellows with this mongrel
trailing at his heels.</p>
<p>The situation sharpened Purt&#8217;s wits. Here was
a store where was sold rope and other ship-chandlery.
He marched in and bought a fathom of
strong manilla line, called the foolish dog to him,
found that he wore a nondescript collar, and
hastily fastened the line to the aforesaid collar.</p>
<p>It was in the boy&#8217;s mind to tie the dog somewhere
and leave it behind. If he had dared, he
would have tied a weight to the other end of the
rope and dropped both weight and dog overboard.</p>
<p>Just then, however, he met a group of ragged,
barefooted urchins&mdash;evidently denizens of the
water-front. They hailed the gaily dressed Purt
and the ragged mongrel, with delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What yer doin&#8217; wid the dawg?&#8221; inquired one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Takin&#8217; him to the bench-show, Clarence? He&#8217;ll
win a blue ribbon, <i>he</i> will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw,&#8221; said another youthful humorist.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t let Clarence out without the dawg.
That&#8217;s to keep Clarence from gettin&#8217; kidnapped.
Nobody would wanter kidnap him if they had ter
take that mutt along, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Purt was too anxious to be offended by these
remarks. He walked directly up to the leader of
the gang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; he exclaimed, breathlessly. &#8220;Do you
want a dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if <i>that&#8217;s</i> what yer call a dawg, Mister,&#8221;
said the other boy. &#8220;I&#8217;d be ashamed to call on me
tony friends wit&#8217; that mutt. What I needs is a
coach-dawg to run under the hind axle of me
landau.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; breathed Purt, heavily, and paying no
attention to the gibes. &#8220;You take this dog and
keep it&mdash;or tie it up somewhere so he can&#8217;t follow
me&mdash;and I&#8217;ll give you a quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do I git the quarter?&#8221; demanded the
boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now,&#8221; declared Purt reaching into his
pocket with his free hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hand it over,&#8221; said the other, snatching away
the rope.</p>
<p>The dude sighed to think how this strange and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
unknown cur had already cost him a dollar and a
quarter. A dollar and a quarter would have
been far too much to pay for a dozen similar mongrels,
and well Purt knew it.</p>
<p>But the instant the quarter was transferred to
the other boy, the Central High exquisite traveled
away from there just as fast as he could walk.</p>
<p>At once a mournful and heart-rending howl
broke out. He looked back once; the dog was
leaping at the length of his rope, nearly capsizing
the holder of the same with every jump, and
wailing hungrily for his fast disappearing friend.</p>
<p>Purt set off on a run. He did not know how
soon that rope might break!</p>
<p>He reached the dock just after the girls, who
had arrived breathless with laughter, and full of
the tale of Purt Sweet&#8217;s new friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; was the chorus that welcomed
Purt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I got rid of him,&#8221; panted Purt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221; laughed Chet, as they began to cast
off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I hope so,&#8221; returned the worried Purt.
&#8220;I never <i>did</i> see such a cweature&mdash;weally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have been an old friend of yours,
Purt,&#8221; said Reddy Butts. &#8220;Dogs don&#8217;t follow
folks for nothing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But weally, I never saw him before,&#8221; Purt
tried to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, that&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; Billy Long sang
out. &#8220;But it&#8217;s plain enough why he followed
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Reddy, willing to help the joke
along.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Purt&#8217;s shanks in those green socks that
attracted the dog. I suppose the poor dog was
hungry, and a hungry dog will go far for a bone,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Purt was hurrying to get his <i>Duchess</i> under
way, and he was so glad of getting rid of the
dog that he did not mind the boys&#8217; chaffing. Suddenly
a wild yell arose from some of the boys on
the dock.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this? See who&#8217;s come!&#8221; yelled
Billy Long.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Barnacle!&#8221; quoth Chet, bursting into a
roar of laughter.</p>
<p>Even Lily Pendleton could not forbear giving
vent to her amusement, and she laughed with the
others. Down the dock tore the ragged coated
dog, with a fathom of rope tied to his collar.</p>
<p>He leaped aboard the <i>Bonnie Lass</i> and then,
with a glad yelp, sprang to the decked-over part
of the <i>Duchess</i>.</p>
<p>Purt Sweet looked up with a cry of amazement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
and received the delighted dog full in his chest.
They rolled together in the cockpit of the boat,
the dog eagerly lapping Purt&#8217;s face, while the boy
tried to beat him off with his fists.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Barnacle!&#8221; yelled Chet again, and that
name stuck.</p>
<p>So did the dog. He refused to leave. The
party left Lumberton with the foolish beast sitting
up in the prow of the <i>Duchess</i>, wagging his
ridiculous tail and barking a last farewell to the
amused spectators gathered along the edge of the
dock.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>UP ROCKY RIVER</h3>
</div>
<p>The second start of the flotilla&mdash;that from
Lumberton&mdash;was a hilarious start indeed. Poor
Prettyman Sweet was the butt of everybody&#8217;s
laughter. The glare of rage he threw now and
then at the ridiculous dog in the bow of the <i>Duchess</i>
sent the boys into spasms of laughter.</p>
<p>The girls in the other motorboat&mdash;even Bobby&mdash;seeing
that their laughter quite offended Lily
Pendleton, began talking about something else
and ignored the Barnacle, as the dog had been so
aptly named.</p>
<p>Reddy Butts and Art Hobbs, however, loved to
annoy the Central High dude. They told Purt
that the Barnacle possessed a family resemblance
to the Sweets that could not be denied.</p>
<p>&#8220;He smiles just like you do, Pretty,&#8221; said Arthur.
&#8220;I declare I wouldn&#8217;t deny the relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows think you are funny,&#8221; snarled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
the dude, losing his temper at last. &#8220;I&#8217;ll fix that
beast!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How you going to do it?&#8221; demanded Reddy,
grinning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come here and take the wheel,&#8221; commanded
the dude. &#8220;See that you steer right and
keep in the channel, right behind Chet&#8217;s boat and
his tow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Butts, and took the spokes in
hand.</p>
<p>Purt, shooting an inquiring glance forward to
see if the girls were watching, began to creep up
on the dog. The beast was looking over the bow,
his tongue hanging out, and evidently enjoying
the rapid sail up Rocky River.</p>
<p>Somebody had removed the rope from his collar
since he had come aboard the <i>Duchess</i>. There
was nothing for Purt to grab had the dog observed
his approach and sought to get away.</p>
<p>However, the dog remained unconscious of the
attempt on his peace of mind. Purt crept nearer
and nearer, while the giggling boys in the cockpit
watched him narrowly.</p>
<p>Reddy looked knowingly at Arthur, and the latter
pulled off his jacket and kicked off his sneakers.
The water was warm and Arthur was a good
swimmer.</p>
<p>The dude, earnestly striving to move softly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
got within hand&#8217;s reach of the dog. Suddenly he
threw himself forward. At the same moment
Reddy twisted the wheel ever so little to starboard.</p>
<p>The <i>Duchess</i> was traveling at a good clip. The
wave at her nose was foam-streaked and spreading
broadly. The water in her wake boiled.</p>
<p>The sudden thrust Purt gave the dog cast the
surprised brute overboard; with a yelp of amazement
he sank beneath the foam-streaked surface
as the motorboat rushed on.</p>
<p>But another yelp echoed the dog&#8217;s; when Reddy
Butts swerved the boat&#8217;s nose, the move was
quite unexpected by Purt.</p>
<p>He dove forward, yelled loudly, and was cast
over the edge of the deck just as sprawlingly as
the Barnacle himself!</p>
<p>&#8220;Man overboard!&#8221; yelled Reddy, scarcely able
to say it for laughter.</p>
<p>The crowd on the other powerboat heard the
shout, if they had not all seen Purt&#8217;s exhibition
of diving. The dude went under just as deep as
the dog, and did not come to the surface anywhere
near as quickly.</p>
<p>The Barnacle, whether he was a water-dog, or
not, was a good swimmer. When his head shot
above the stream he yelped, started to paddle
after the <i>Duchess</i> and her tow, saw that that was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
useless, and turned toward the southerly bank of
the stream.</p>
<p>The river was half a mile wide at this place,
and the Barnacle left a wake like a motorboat
behind him. He was going to reach the shore
all right.</p>
<p>How about the master he had adopted? Purt
came to the surface more slowly, but when he got
there he emitted a shriek like a steam whistle.</p>
<p>The <i>Duchess</i> had gone ahead of him. Arthur
Hobbs was poised to leap overboard; but there
swept close to the dude one of the trailing canoes,
and just by raising an arm Purt reached it.</p>
<p>He clung to the gunwale and was dragged on
behind the <i>Duchess</i>. At first the canoe tipped and
threatened to turn over; Purt slipped along to the
stern, and there got a grip on both sides, and so
trailed on behind, getting his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Reddy, chuckling. &#8220;Let
him cool off a little, Art.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls aboard the <i>Bonnie Lass</i> were somewhat
worried over Purt Sweet&#8217;s predicament.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be drowned!&#8221; Lily Pendeton declared,
first of all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of that,&#8221; Bobby said. &#8220;But
if that suit of his shrinks, what a sight he&#8217;ll be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no time for light talk,&#8221; declared Jess
Morse. &#8220;Purt isn&#8217;t a very good swimmer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; exclaimed Nellie, rather tartly for
her, &#8220;how did he know whether that poor dog
could swim, or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as though he had finally gotten rid of
the Barnacle, just the same,&#8221; laughed Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that,&#8221; responded her brother,
darkly. &#8220;That dog has the stick-to-it-iveness of
fish-glue. Wait and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Arthur Hobbs drew in the canoe
Purt was clinging to, and soon helped the gasping
dude into the large boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! oh!&#8221; cried Purt. &#8220;I might have known
that horrid dog was bad luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having seen the exquisite dragged aboard the
<i>Duchess</i>, most of the girls on the other powerboat
gave their attention to the dog. Indeed, his
fate all the time had attracted more attention from
Lizzie Bean, than had the trouble Purt Sweet was
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! he might have been drowned!&#8221; Lily
exclaimed in answer to something Bobby said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. And it would be too mean,&#8221;
spoke up Lonesome Liz, as Billy Long secretly
called the sad-faced girl. &#8220;He&#8217;s a smart dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy! who cares about that horrid dog?&#8221;
snapped Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, for one,&#8221; said Nellie Agnew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too. He was pushed overboard by Purt,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
and it just served Purt right that he went into the
water,&#8221; Bobby declared.</p>
<p>The mongrel cur had swum nobly for the shore.
Before Purt was dragged aboard by Art the dog
was nearing his goal.</p>
<p>They were well above the town of Lumberport
now, and the shore along here was a shelving
beach. After fighting the current the dog would
have been unable to drag himself out had the
bank been steep.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done it!&#8221; exclaimed Liz, eagerly.
&#8220;Well! I declare I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladder than you were over Purt?&#8221; chuckled
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you ask me,&#8221; drawled the maid-of-all-work,
&#8220;I think the dog&#8217;s wuth a whole lot
more than that silly feller in the green pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How horrid!&#8221; ejaculated Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, Lizzie,
that there is only <i>one</i> Pretty Sweet? I don&#8217;t
suppose you could find another fellow like him if
you combed the zones of both hemispheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! hear!&#8221; drawled Jess. &#8220;How many
zones do you suppose there are, Bobs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a whole bunch of them,&#8221; declared the
reckless Bobby. &#8220;There&#8217;s one torrid, two temperate,
two frigid, and a lot of postal zones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How smart!&#8221; sneered Lily, in no very good
temper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile the dog had crawled out of the
water. They saw him shake himself and then
sink upon the shore, evidently exhausted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Laura, &#8220;I guess Purt has finally
gotten rid of the poor creature. But it was too
funny for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shores of Rocky River, as they advanced,
were very pretty indeed. There were several suburban
villages near Lumberport; but the farther
they sailed up the stream the less inhabited the
shores were and the wilder the scenery became.</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; ejaculated Dorothy. &#8220;I had no idea
this country was really so <i>woodsy</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know there is scarcely anything but forest
south of us, until you reach the B. &amp; P. W.
Railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe there are bad people up in these woods,
after all,&#8221; suggested the timid Nell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind. Purt&#8217;s got his revolver,&#8221;
chuckled Jess. &#8220;Lance says that it is one that
hasn&#8217;t been fired for twenty years and belonged
to Purt&#8217;s father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; exclaimed Laura. &#8220;I <i>shall</i> be
afraid of that. It&#8217;s those old guns that nobody
supposes are loaded, that are always going off and
killing the innocent bystander. You ought to
confiscate that gun, Chet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; returned her brother, laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the trigger screw out of Purt&#8217;s gun
and he couldn&#8217;t shoot it if he had forty cartridges
in it. But I haven&#8217;t told Purt, for the dear boy
seems to place implicit confidence in the old gat
as a defense against anything on two or four legs
in the Big Woods.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE CAMP ON ACORN ISLAND</h3>
</div>
<p>Although it was high noon when they were
at Lumberport the Girls of Central High and their
boy friends had not lunched there. Indeed, they
waited to reach a certain pleasant grove which
some of them knew about, on the south shore of
the river, and several miles above the spot where
Purt Sweet had taken his involuntary ducking.</p>
<p>As the motorboats put ashore and the boys tied
them to stubs in the high bank, they all began
joking Purt about his plunge into the river. The
dude had been obliged to exchange his natty outing
suit of Lincoln green for a suit of oil-stained
overalls that he found in the cabin of the <i>Duchess</i>.
He could not find his own baggage, as the boys
with him had hidden it.</p>
<p>As for the tam-o&#8217;-shanter, it had fallen off and
floated down the stream. Purt would never see
that remarkable headgear again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t what the boy is worrying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
about,&#8221; chuckled Lancelot Darby, as the party
came ashore with the luncheon hampers. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the fate of the Barnacle that is corroding Purt&#8217;s
sensitive soul!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you make that out?&#8221; demanded
Reddy Butts, broadly grinning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, isn&#8217;t it a fact that he went in after the
dog? I saw him dive right after the poor thing
when it fell overboard. It was a mighty brave
attempt at rescue, I should say&mdash;especially when
we all know that Purt swims about as good as a
stone fence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some hero, Purt is,&#8221; agreed Billy Long,
chuckling.</p>
<p>&#8220;And didn&#8217;t he make that dive gracefully?&#8221;
demanded Reddy, bursting with laughter to think
how he had shot the dude overboard by a sly twist
of the wheel on the <i>Duchess</i>.</p>
<p>Purt was really ashamed of his present appearance.
He felt it necessary to excuse it to the
girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weally,&#8221; he said, when he came ashore, &#8220;I
am not pwesentible; but I hope you ladies understand
that it was an unavoidable accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said Laura, gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I assure you, Miss Belding,&#8221; Purt hastened
to say, &#8220;I had no intention of going overboard&mdash;weally!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you were not actually trying to rescue the
dog?&#8221; demanded Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;That howwible cweature!&#8221; gasped Purt, in
disgust. &#8220;I would fling him from the tallest cliff
there is&mdash;could I safely do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And not try to dive after him&mdash;eh?&#8221;
chuckled Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are cruelty incarnate!&#8221; exclaimed Jess,
gravely. &#8220;I am horrified to find that we have a
boy at Central High who would willingly destroy
such a beautiful&mdash;Oh! oh!&#8221; shrieked Jess, who
had been facing a thick path of woods below this
open camping place. &#8220;What is <i>that</i>? It&#8217;s a
bear!&#8221; she concluded, asking and answering the
question herself.</p>
<p>She started in a very lively fashion for the
boats. Some of the other girls were quite as
agile. Like the word &#8220;mouse&#8221; in domestic
scenes, the cry of &#8220;Bear!&#8221; in ruder surroundings
&#8220;always gets a rise out of the girls,&#8221; as Chet
Belding slangily expressed it.</p>
<p>But it was not a bear. Purt Sweet was stooping
to aid in blowing up the flame of the campfire
over which they proposed making Mrs. Morse a
cup of tea. He did not see the &#8220;bear&#8221; coming.</p>
<p>But the other boys recognized the object that
had so frightened Jess, and they burst into a roar
of laughter. Out of the bushes and across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
opening in the wood came a half wet, bedraggled
dog, which, with a joyful whine, leaped upon the
individual who had so fatally attracted his doggish
love and loyalty!</p>
<p>&#8220;The Barnacle!&#8221; yelled Chet. &#8220;What did I
tell you? Talk about &#8216;the cat coming back?&#8217;
Crickey! the cat wasn&#8217;t in it with this mongrel of
Purt&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the exuberance of his joy Barnacle fairly
pitched Purt across the fire, and tipped over the
pail of water that had been hung over it to boil.
The dude seemed fated to fall into trouble on this
first day of the outing.</p>
<p>But now Purt was mad! He scrambled up,
found a club, and chased the barking Barnacle
all about the camp. The dog would not be chased
away. Perhaps he had observed Lizzie opening
the lunch baskets. Besides, he seemed to take
everything Purt tried to do to him as a game of
play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do leave the dog alone, Purt!&#8221; exclaimed
Lil, at last. &#8220;You&#8217;re making yourself perfectly
ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily Pendleton&#8217;s opinion had weight with
Pretty Sweet. He sat down, gloomy and breathless,
and tried to ignore the Barnacle.</p>
<p>The latter sat on his tail all through the
<i>alfresco</i> meal, directly behind Purt. The dude gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
him no attention; but the other boys threw pieces
of meat and sweet crackers into the air for the
Barnacle to catch.</p>
<p>Could he catch them? Why! it seemed as
though the dog must have been trained for just
that trick. He never missed a bite!</p>
<p>When his appetite was satisfied the mongrel
began to try to attract Purt&#8217;s attention. Every
time Purt reached for anything, the Barnacle&#8217;s
cold, wet nose was right there! It was a plain
case of &#8220;love at first sight,&#8221; as Bobby remarked.
Nothing could convince that dog that Purt was
not his loving friend.</p>
<p>But finally the dude&#8217;s serious air and his efforts
to reach the dog with a particularly well-shod
foot, made an impression on the Barnacle. He
squatted down before Purt and lifting up his
head, uttered a howl that would have brought
tears to the eyes of a graven image.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll break the poor dog&#8217;s heart, Purt,&#8221; said
Jess, gravely. &#8220;Give him a kind word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has the most sorrowful face on him of
any dog I ever saw,&#8221; declared Dora Lockwood.
&#8220;Look at him kindly, even if you can&#8217;t speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; whispered Dorothy, her twin. &#8220;He
has almost as sorrowful a face as Lizzie&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! there&#8217;s a pair of them,&#8221; sighed Bobby,
ecstatically. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take the dog with us to be a
comrade for Liz.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>Indeed, Lizzie Bean petted the mongrel, which
hung around the camp until the picnickers started
up the river again.</p>
<p>There was another disturbance when Purt tried
to slip aboard the <i>Duchess</i> without the dog. The
Barnacle whined, and howled, and jumped aboard,
and was finally driven ashore with an oar.</p>
<p>The motorboats and their tows got off into the
stream. There sat the deserted dog on his tail,
howling most dismally as the boats drew up
stream and left him behind.</p>
<p>Laura called to Purt in the other boat: &#8220;Never
mind, Mr. Sweet, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be troubled
with that dog any more. It&#8217;s twenty miles to
Lake Dunkirk. He will never follow you that
far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet the Barnacle haunts Purt in his dreams,&#8221;
exclaimed Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! say not so!&#8221; begged Billy Long. &#8220;If
Purt has the nightmare and draws that &#8216;family
friend,&#8217; the faithful revolver, on the ghost of the
dog&mdash;Good-<i>night</i>! Like enough he&#8217;ll blow us all
out of the tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet that Barnacle dogs his &#8216;feetsteps&#8217; for
the rest of Purt&#8217;s mortal existence,&#8221; declared
Chet, prophetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing,&#8221; said Lil Pendleton, &#8220;the nasty
beast can&#8217;t follow us to Acorn Island.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And we won&#8217;t get there ourselves to-day, if
we don&#8217;t hurry,&#8221; Chet said. &#8220;Come on, Pretty!
let&#8217;s see what your little <i>Duchess</i> can do,&#8221; and he
speeded up the engine of the <i>Bonnie Lass</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have some distance to go, that&#8217;s a fact,&#8221;
said Nellie. &#8220;The island is two miles beyond the
end of Rocky River.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bigger powerboat pulled away from the
<i>Duchess</i> and the two parties ceased shouting back
and forth. Mrs. Morse was trying to get a nap,
so the girls did not sing. But they told jokes and
stories, and of course Bobby gave one of her
jingles:</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>Now, how is that for a match for <i>your</i> limerick?&#8221;</p>
<p>This started the ball a-rolling. Dora Lockwood
raised her hand, crying,</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, teacher! I have one,&#8221; and immediately
produced this:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>

<p>This woke up Dorothy Lockwood, who would
not be outdone by her twin. She recited:</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott, girl!&#8221; gasped Chet. &#8220;That almost
twisted your tongue out of kilter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any more?&#8221; queried Lance, who likewise
had wonderingly listened to this display of talent.
&#8220;Ah-ha! I see Nellie just bursting with
one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I have a good one,&#8221; admitted the doctor&#8217;s

</td></tr></table>
<p>Now! let&#8217;s hear you say <i>that</i> fast?&#8221;</p>
<p>This certainly was a teaser and the boys admitted
it. Finally somebody shouted for Mother
Wit. &#8220;Come on, Laura! where are you?&#8221; demanded
Bobby. &#8220;Are you going to let us mere
&#8216;amachoors&#8217; beat you? Give us a limerick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mother Wit was expected to keep up with the
other wits, that was sure. So she obliged with:</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;And now, boys, while we have been entertaining
you,&#8221; concluded Laura, &#8220;you have gotten behind
the <i>Duchess</i> again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Lance,&#8221; said Chet. &#8220;Give her
some more power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Electricity is a wonderful thing,&#8221; said Jess,
seriously. &#8220;Just think how fast it travels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How fast?&#8221; demanded Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like 250,000 miles a second, I read
somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; remarked Bobby, grinning, &#8220;if it
hits anybody, it tells the judge it was going about
ten miles an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were out for a good time and could laugh
at almost anything that was said, or was done.
Freed from what Bobby called &#8220;the scholastic
yoke,&#8221; the whole world seemed a big joke to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we&#8217;re going to have the finest kind of
a time at Acorn Island!&#8221; the cut-up exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! I hope there&#8217;s nothing much to do there
to-night, save to eat supper,&#8221; Jess said, yawning.
&#8220;So much ozone is already making me sleepy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father Tom promised to have a man there to
meet us, who would even have the fire going and
the teakettle boiling,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;You see, he&#8217;s
been up here hunting and fishing, and these guides
all know him. He can get what he wants from
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boats chugged on up the river and finally,
as the evening began to draw in, they sighted the
broadening sheet of water which they knew to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
Lake Dunkirk. The lake was longer, but much
narrower, than Lake Luna, and it was surrounded
by an unbroken line of forest.</p>
<p>The sun was setting. Its last beams shone
upon the island which lay about two miles above
the entrance to Rocky River, and that island
looked like an emerald floating on the blue water.</p>
<p>The light was fast fading out of the sky, save
where the west was still riotous with colors. The
big oaks on Acorn Island grew black as the shadows
gathered beneath them.</p>
<p>At the nearer end was the hillock where they
were to camp. Here the grove was open and they
could see the cabin standing, with two tents beside
it. One of the tents had a raised flap, and
there was the stovepipe with a curl of smoke
coming out of it.</p>
<p>Down at the edge of the shore&mdash;a smooth and
sheltered bit of beach where the landing was easy&mdash;a
man was sitting, smoking his pipe. A beautiful
canoe, of Indian manufacture, had its bow
drawn up beside him.</p>
<p>The boys and girls shouted a welcome as they
drove in toward the shore. He rose, knocking
the ashes from his pipe, and waved a hand toward
the camp above. He was a tall man, almost as
black as a negro, with long, black hair, and was
barefooted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; he grunted, gutturally. Then he
pushed off, stepped into his canoe, and paddled
away without another word.</p>
<p>The boats were beached and the young people
began to disembark. Before the guide in the
canoe got half way to the northern shore of the
lake, he was lost to their sight, the darkness came
down so suddenly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>GETTING USED TO IT</h3>
</div>
<p>The boys were in haste to get to their own
camping site, which was across from the island on
the southern shore of Lake Dunkirk. So they
hurried the baggage belonging to Mrs. Morse and
the girls to the cabin, and then prepared to embark
again with their own boats.</p>
<p>Chet saw to it that everything appeared to be in
good shape about the camp on the island knoll,
and he drew up the three canoes belonging to the
girls, himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you girls get into trouble to-night,
toot this thing,&#8221; and Chet produced an automobile
horn which he had brought along for the purpose.
&#8220;If you need us by day, Laura knows how to wig-wag
with those flags. I taught her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake, Chet!&#8221; exclaimed Jess, with
some asperity. &#8220;Do you suppose we are going to
need you boys every hour, or so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not!&#8221; added Lil Pendleton. &#8220;Surely
we ought to be able to get along in camp just as
well as you boys.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! hear!&#8221; cried Bobby. &#8220;How are you
going to summon us if you need help, my dear
little boys? Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t we give you each a penny
whistle so you can call us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Chet only laughed. Lance said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve been
camping before; most of you girls haven&#8217;t. Of
course you will get into trouble forty times to our
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! I like that,&#8221; sniffed Jess, who did not
like it at all. &#8220;If girls aren&#8217;t just as well able to
take care of themselves, as boys, I&#8217;d like to know
why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jess is getting to be a regular suffragette,&#8221;
chuckled Dora Lockwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reminds me of the little girl whose mother
was chasing the hens out of the garden,&#8221; said
Laura, with her low laugh. &#8220;The hen-chaser declared
that &#8216;You can&#8217;t teach a hen anything, to
save your life,&#8217; when the little girl spoke up for
her sex, and said: &#8216;Well! I think they know quite
as much as the roosters!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; teased Lance, as the
boys got under way. &#8220;I bet this bunch of hens on
Acorn Island will holler for us roosters before we
set the distress signal for <i>them</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out, you horrid thing!&#8221; cried Bobby.
&#8220;Calling us hens. We&#8217;re only pullets, at best.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lantern had been lit in each tent, for the shadows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
were thickening under the oak trees on the
knoll. Lizzie Bean at once began to overhaul the
cooking utensils and supplies in the cook-tent.</p>
<p>This tent was divided into two parts. Lizzie&#8217;s
own cot was in the rear apartment. There was a
long table, roughly built but serviceable, in the
front with the stove and chest of drawers. There
were folding campstools in plenty.</p>
<p>In the cabin was a comfortable straw mattress
for Mrs. Morse in the wide bunk, a small table on
which her typewriter case already stood, a rocker
made in rustic fashion, a painted dressing case
with mirror of good size, and shelves for books.</p>
<p>A small fire was burning on the hearth, for the
cabin was apt to be damp after its many months
of abandonment. It had been swept and garnished
with boughs of sweet-smelling spruce and
pine.</p>
<p>The girls&#8217; sleeping tent housed seven cots, all
supplied with unbleached cotton sheets and heavy
double blankets. Lil Pendleton looked about it
when she brought in her bag, and shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re &#8217;way
out here in the wilderness if we&#8217;re going to dress
and undress in this thing. Why! I shall feel just
as much exposed as though the sides were made
of window-glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; sniffed Bobby, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
been camping with her father and had spent many
a night in a tent. &#8220;You&#8217;re too particular, Lil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who asked <i>you</i> to put in your oar?&#8221; demanded
Miss Pendleton, crossly. &#8220;I have a right
to my opinion, I hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hope it was nobody else&#8217;s opinion,&#8221;
returned Miss Bobby, quick to pick up the gauntlet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, girls!&#8221; advised Mother Wit. &#8220;Let us
not be quarrelsome. We don&#8217;t want Mrs. Morse
to think we are female savages right at the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lil sniffed; but good-tempered Bobby said,
quickly: &#8220;You&#8217;re right, Laura. I beg the company&#8217;s
pardon&mdash;and Lil&#8217;s particularly. We must
be &#8216;little birds who in their nest agree.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fine bird, Bobby,&#8221; laughed Dora.
&#8220;Come on! I hear the dishes rattling. Let&#8217;s see
what Lizzie has tossed up for supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if she managed to boil the water
without burning it?&#8221; giggled Jess. &#8220;She&#8217;s the
funniest girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you and Laura could have
found a maid who wasn&#8217;t quite such a gawk,&#8221;
muttered Lil, unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; admonished Mother Wit. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let her hear you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; snapped Lil.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will hurt her feelings.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! she&#8217;s paid for it&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for having her feelings hurt,&#8221; declared
Laura, sternly. &#8220;And I won&#8217;t have it. She&#8217;s
odd; but she is quite as quick of hearing as the
next person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you&#8217;re too particular, Laura,&#8221; drawled
Lil. But she stood a little in awe of Mother Wit.</p>
<p>They joined Mrs. Morse and filed into the cook-tent.
Lizzie&#8217;s flushed face appeared behind the
steaming biscuits and a big platter of ham and
eggs. They did not really know how hungry they
were until they sat down to these viands.</p>
<p>Lizzie stood with arms akimbo and waited for
the verdict upon the cooking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most excellent, Lizzie,&#8221; Mrs. Morse said,
kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits ye, does it?&#8221; asked the strange girl. &#8220;I
flatter myself them biscuits air light enough to
sleep on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are a good deal more feathery than our
&#8216;downy couches&#8217; here in camp, I warrant, Lizzie,&#8221;
laughed Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad ye like &#8217;em. There&#8217;s plenty of biscuits&mdash;don&#8217;t
be bashful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jess giggled when she saw Lil&#8217;s face. &#8220;How
rude!&#8221; muttered Miss Pendleton. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
what you and Mother Wit were thinking about
when you hired that girl.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking of you, Lily&mdash;thinking of you,&#8221; declared
Jess. &#8220;She will willingly do your share
of the dish-washing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dish-washing? Fancy!&#8221; exclaimed Lil.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; put in the omnipresent
Bobby. &#8220;Not if I had to eat after your manipulation
of the dish-mop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t come to do anything like <i>that</i>,&#8221;
wailed Lil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same we have got to do a part of the
camp work,&#8221; declared Mother Wit. &#8220;It all can&#8217;t
be shoved off onto Lizzie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us arrange about that right here and
now,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Morse!&#8221; cried Nell, eagerly.
&#8220;First of all I vote that Mrs. Morse is not called
upon to do a thing! She&#8217;s company as well as
chaperon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will make my own bed,&#8221; said the lady, smiling.
&#8220;You girls can take turns sweeping and
dusting the cabin, if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And making the beds and cleaning up our
tent,&#8221; added Laura. &#8220;Two at a time&mdash;it won&#8217;t
seem so hard if two work together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that leaves an odd girl,&#8221; suggested Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll change about. The odd girl shall help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the cook. And one meal a day&mdash;either breakfast,
dinner, or supper&mdash;we girls must cook, and Lizzie
is going to have nothing to do with that
meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! <i>I</i> can&#8217;t cook,&#8221; wailed Lil again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good time for you to begin to learn, then,&#8221;
Laura said, laughingly.</p>
<p>Some of the other girls looked disturbed at
the prospect. &#8220;I can make fudge,&#8221; observed
Nell, honestly, &#8220;but I never really tried anything
else, except to make toast and tea for mother
when she was ill and the maid was out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to that!&#8221; exclaimed the voice of Lizzie
Bean, who had been listening frankly to the
dialogue. &#8220;An&#8217; I been doin&#8217; plain cookin&#8217; an&#8217;
heavy sweepin&#8217; and hard scrubbin&#8217; ever since I
was knee-high to a toadstool!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby burst out laughing. &#8220;So have I, Lizzie!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;Only I have done it for Father
Tom and my kid brothers and sisters when Mrs.
Betsey was sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lily Pendleton turned up her nose&mdash;literally.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have trouble with that girl,&#8221;
she announced to Nellie. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know her
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>But whatever Lizzie knew, or did not know, she
did not shirk her share of the work. She stayed
up after everybody else had retired and washed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
every pot and pan and plate, and set her bread
to rise for morning, and stirred up a big pitcher
of flapjack flour to rise over night, peeled potatoes
to fry, leaving them in cold water so they
would not turn black, and set the long table fresh
for breakfast.</p>
<p>When the earliest riser among the girls (who
was Laura herself) peeped into the cooking tent
at daybreak, the fire in the stove was already
roaring, and Lizzie had gone down to the shore
to wash her face and hands in the cold water.
Laura ran down in her bathing suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of this place, Lizzie?&#8221;
she asked the solemn-faced girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the land&#8217;s sake, Miss!&#8221; drawled Lizzie
Bean, &#8220;I never had no idea the woods was so
lonesome&mdash;for a fac&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sh&#8217;d say not! I went to bed and lay there
an&#8217; listened. The trees creaked, and the crickets
twittered, and some bird had the nightmare an&#8217;
kep&#8217; cryin&#8217; like a baby&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect that was a screech-owl, Lizzie,&#8221; interrupted
Laura. &#8220;They come out only at
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness to gracious! Do they come out
<i>every</i> night?&#8221; demanded the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And them frogs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are tree-toads. Yes, they are here
all summer, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness to gracious! And folks like to live
in the woods? Well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you can stand it?&#8221; queried
Laura, much amused, yet somewhat anxious, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to get all that money
every week it&#8217;ll take more than birds with the
nightmare an&#8217; a passel of frogs to drive me away.
Now! when do you want breakfast, Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until Mrs. Morse gets up. And none of
the other girls are out yet,&#8221; said Laura.</p>
<p>But very soon the other girls began to appear.
They had agreed to have a dip the first thing,
and the girls who first got into the water squealed
so because of the cold, that it routed out the lie-abeds.</p>
<p>Lily would not venture in. She sat on a stump,
with a blanket wrapped around her, and shivered,
and yawned, and refused to plunge in with the
others.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s so early,&#8221; she complained. &#8220;I had
no idea you&#8217;d all get up so early and make such a
racket. Why, when there isn&#8217;t school, I <i>never</i>
get up before nine o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! how different your life is going to be on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Acorn Island,&#8221; said Bobby, frankly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be
a new girl by the time we go back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a new girl,&#8221; grumbled Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, isn&#8217;t that just like her?&#8221; said Bobby,
<i>sotto voce</i>. &#8220;She is perfectly satisfied with herself
as she is. Humph! Lucky she <i>is</i> satisfied, I
s&#8217;pose, for nobody else could be!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>LIZ SEES A &#8220;HA&#8217;NT&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>After their bath the girls got into their gymnasium
costumes. Then they clamored for breakfast,
and had Mrs. Morse not appeared just then
there certainly would have been a riot at the cook-tent.
Lizzie was a stickler for orders, and she
would not begin to fry cakes until Jess&#8217; mother
gave the signal.</p>
<p>Flapjacks! My! weren&#8217;t they good, with
butter and syrup, followed by bacon and eggs and
French fried potatoes? The girls ate for a solid
hour. Lizzie&#8217;s face was the color of a well-burned
brick when the girls admitted they were
satisfied. The out-of-door air had given even Lil
an enormous appetite.</p>
<p>&#8220;If my mother had any idea that I&#8217;d eat so
much at this time in the morning she&#8217;d never have
let me come camping,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why! do you
know&mdash;I only drink a cup of coffee and pick the
inside out of a roll, at breakfast, at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general inclination to &#8220;laze&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
about the camp and read, or take naps after that
heavy breakfast. But Laura would not allow the
other six girls of Central High any peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we have a big ham and a case of
eggs with us,&#8221; said Mother Wit. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t
want to eat ham and eggs, or bacon and eggs,
three times a day while we stay here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beside, the eggs, at least, won&#8217;t hold out.
We must add to the larder&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Dora Lockwood.
&#8220;Paddle to the mainland and kill some farmer&#8217;s
cow to get beef?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; Laura said, laughing. &#8220;We
must, however, make an attempt to coax some of
the finny denizens of the lake out of it and into
Lizzie&#8217;s fry-pan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fishing!&#8221; cried Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never went fishing in my life,&#8221; complained
Lil.</p>
<p>But the other girls of Central High were not
like Lil&mdash;no, indeed! They had been out with
the boys on Lake Luna&mdash;both in summer and
winter&mdash;and every one of them knew how to put
a worm on a hook.</p>
<p>Lil squealed at the thought of &#8220;using one of
the squirmy things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you give me a pain!&#8221; said Bobby.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t act as though you were made of something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
different from the rest of us. A worm
never bit me yet, and I&#8217;ve been fishing thousands
of times, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lil did not hear her, however. She was the
only girl who had not brought fishing tackle.
When she saw her six schoolmates going about
the work of tolling the finny denizens of Lake
Dunkirk onto the bank, she began to be jealous of
the fun they were having. White perch, and
roach, and now and then a lake trout, were being
landed.</p>
<p>Lil got excited. She wanted to try her hand
at the sport, too. Yes! Bobby had an extra outfit,
and she even cut Lil a pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I tell you what it is, Miss,&#8221; said the black-eyed
girl, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to hold you responsible for
this outfit. If you break anything, or lose anything,
or snarl the line up, you&#8217;ll have to pay me
for it. I paid good money for that silk line and
those hooks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lil promised to make good if anything happened
to the fishing tackle. She took her place on
a rock near Bobby and made a cast. The other
girls were very busy themselves and paid Lil very
little attention.</p>
<p>The fish were biting freely, for the morning
was cloudy and these waters about Acorn Island
were far from being &#8220;fished out.&#8221; Bobby hauled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
in a couple of perch and had almost forgotten
about Lil, when the latter said, mournfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Clara.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! what is it?&#8221; demanded the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you call that little thing that bobbed
up and down on the water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The float,&#8221; replied the busy Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Clara!&#8221; whined Lil, mournfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! what is it?&#8221; snapped the busy fisherman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to buy you a new one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy me <i>what</i>?&#8221; demanded the surprised
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new float.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; was the amazed demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because that one you lent me <i>has sunk</i>,&#8221;
mourned Lily.</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake!&#8221; shrieked Bobby.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a bite!&#8221;</p>
<p>She dropped her own pole, ran to the amazed
Lily, and dragged in a big bullpout&mdash;sometimes
called &#8220;catfish&#8221;&mdash;that was sulking in the mud at
the bottom, with Lil&#8217;s hook firmly fastened in its
jaws.</p>
<p>Lil shrieked. She would not touch the wriggling,
black fish. She was afraid of being
&#8220;horned,&#8221; she said!</p>
<p>Bobby put her foot on the fish and managed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
extract the hook. Then she baited the hook again
and bade Lil try her luck once more.</p>
<p>But the amateur fisherman was doomed to ill-luck
on this occasion. She had scarcely dropped
the bait into the water, when a fierce little head
appeared right at the surface. It swallowed the
bait&mdash;hook and all&mdash;at a gulp, and swam right
toward the shore where Lil stood.</p>
<p>She began to squeal again: &#8220;A snake! a snake!
Oh, Bobby, I&#8217;m deathly afraid of snakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; rejoined Bobby. &#8220;But you won&#8217;t
catch a snake in the water with a hook and line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;ve caught one!</i>&#8221; gasped the frightened Lil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; growled Bobby. &#8220;You&#8217;re more
trouble than a box of bald-headed monkeys.
What is the matter&mdash;Oo! it&#8217;s a snapper!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221; cried Lil, dropping the fishpole.</p>
<p>&#8220;A snapping turtle,&#8221; explained Bobby.
&#8220;Now you <i>have</i> caught it! I&#8217;ll lose hook and all,
like enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>She jerked the turtle ashore. Lil had seen only
its reptilian head. The beast proved to be more
than a foot across.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes bully soup,&#8221; said the practical Bobby.
&#8220;But he won&#8217;t willingly let go of that bait and the
hook in a month of Sundays.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ran up to the camp and came flying back
in a minute with the camp-hatchet. Lil grew bold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
enough to hold the line taut. The turtle pulled
back, and Bobby caught it just right and cut its
head off!</p>
<p>Although Lonesome Liz had never seen a turtle
before, she managed to clean it and with Mrs.
Morse&#8217;s advice made a pot of soup. Lizzie was
getting bolder as the hours passed; but she announced
to Laura that she believed there must be
&#8220;ha&#8217;nts&#8221; in the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is a haunt?&#8221; asked Laura, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead folks that ain&#8217;t contented in their
minds,&#8221; declared the queer girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why should the spirits of the dead haunt
<i>these</i> woods?&#8221; asked Laura. &#8220;Seems to me it&#8217;s
an awfully out of the way place for dead people
to come to.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lizzie would not give up her belief in the
&#8220;spooks.&#8221;</p>
<p>That first day in camp the girls had no visitors.
Through their binoculars and opera glasses, they
could see the boys very active about their camp
across the lake. It was plain they were too busy
to visit Acorn Island.</p>
<p>The girls of Central High, however, had plenty
of fun without the boys. Only Bobby declared
that Lil principally spent the time staring through
her opera glasses across the lake, wishing Purt
would come over in the <i>Duchess;</i> but Lil angrily
denied <i>that.</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you stop trying to stir up a rumpus,
Miss,&#8221; commanded Laura, to the cut-up. &#8220;Let
us live, if we can, like a Happy Family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; drawled Jess, &#8220;Mother Wit is nothing
if not optimistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! what is your idea of an optimist?&#8221;
demanded Nellie Agnew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; Jess said, smiling quietly, &#8220;I read of
a real optimist once. He was strolling along a
country road and an automobile came along and
hit him in the back. It knocked him twenty feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, well!&#8217; said he, as he got up, &#8216;I was
going in this direction, anyway.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, say!&#8221; put in Bobby, &#8220;that&#8217;s all right for
a <i>story;</i> but <i>my</i> idea of a real optimist is a man
who&#8217;s dead broke, going into a restaurant and ordering
oysters on the half shell with the hope
that he can pay for the dinner by finding a pearl
in one of the bivalves.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all laughed at that, and then Laura said:</p>
<p>&#8220;To get back to our original conversation, let
us see if we can&#8217;t get on in <i>this</i> camp without
friction. And that means that <i>you</i>, Bobby, must
set a watch on your tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose my tongue is&mdash;a timekeeper?&#8221;
cried the irreverent Bobby.</p>
<p>Laura herself helped get dinner, the main dish
of which was fried fish. And how good they
tasted, fresh out of the lake!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Morse had kept her typewriter tapping at
a swift pace in the cabin, and she could scarcely
be coaxed to leave her story long enough to eat
dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;This quietude is an incentive to good work,&#8221;
she said, reflectively, at table. &#8220;I shall be sorry
to go back to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was very early in their experience to say
<i>that.</i> Lizzie Bean was not yet an enthusiast for
the simple life, that was sure. She and Mother
Wit had gotten better acquainted during the
preparations for the noonday meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never been crazy about the country
myself,&#8221; admitted Liz. &#8220;Cows, and bugs, and
muskeeters, and frogs, don&#8217;t seem so int&#8217;restin&#8217; to
me as steam cars, and pitcher shows, and sody-water
fountains, and street pianners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the crowds, I do. A place where all ye
hear all day is a mowin&#8217; merchine clackin&#8217;, or see
a hoss switchin&#8217; his tail to keep off the bluebottles,
didn&#8217;t never coax me, <i>much.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bucolic life does not tempt you, then?&#8221;
said Laura, her eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard it called that afore. Colic&#8217;s it
serious thing&mdash;&#8217;specially with babies. But the
city suits me, I can tell ye,&#8221; said Liz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never seen no-one that liked the woods like
you gals seem to before, &#8217;ceptin&#8217; a feller that lived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
in the boardin&#8217; house I worked at in Albany. He
was a bug on campin&#8217; and fishin&#8217; and gunnin&#8217;, and
all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you work in Albany?&#8221; queried Laura,
surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Last year. I had a right good place,
too. Plenty of work. I got up at four o&#8217;clock in
the mornin&#8217; and I never <i>did</i> get through at
night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. I love work. It keeps yer mind off yer
troubles, if you have enough and plenty to do.
But if yer have too much of it, yer get fed up, as
ye might say. I didn&#8217;t get time to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura had to laugh at that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. That chap I tell you about was the
nicest chap I ever see. He was kind to me, too.
When I cut my thumb most off&mdash;see the scar?&mdash;a-slicin&#8217;
bread in that boardin&#8217; house, the missis
put me out &#8217;cause I couldn&#8217;t do my work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How mean!&#8221; exclaimed Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! ye don&#8217;t know about boardin&#8217; house
missises. They ain&#8217;t human,&#8221; said Liz, confidently.
&#8220;But Mr. Norman, he seen me goin&#8217; out
with my verlise, and he knowed about my sore
thumb. He slipped me five dollars out o&#8217; his
pocket. But he was rich,&#8221; sighed Liz, ecstatically.
&#8220;He owned a bank.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Owned a bank?&#8221; gasped Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And lived in a cheap boarding house?&#8221; for
Laura knew that Liz could not have worked in a
very aristocratic place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! he went to a bank every day,&#8221; said the
simple girl. &#8220;And if he warn&#8217;t rich why should
he have slipped me the five dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True&mdash;very true,&#8221; admitted Laura, much
amused.</p>
<p>But she did not think it so funny that evening
when, as the girls sat about a fire they had made
in the open, singing and telling jokes, and Lizzie
was washing up the supper dishes, a sudden shrill
whoop arose from the cook-tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! what&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded the slangy
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;A mouse!&#8221; declared Nellie. &#8220;That funny
girl must be just as much afraid of them as <i>I</i> am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;s nothing worse than a mouse,&#8221; Lil
said, tremblingly.</p>
<p>Laura had sprung up on the instant and run
to the cook tent. Liz had dropped a pile of plates,
and some of them were broken. She had deposited
herself stiffly in a campstool. Her body
was quite stiffened and her eyes fairly bulged&mdash;and
it was not easy for Liz Bean&#8217;s eyes <i>to</i> bulge!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Liz?&#8221; demanded Laura,
seizing her by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen him,&#8221; gasped Liz.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Him</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t mean anything to me,&#8221; declared
Laura, shaking her. &#8220;Who <i>is</i> he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The feller I was tellin&#8217; you about. That feller
that give me the five dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ma&#8217;am!&#8221; uttered Liz, solemnly. &#8220;He
was standin&#8217; right yonder&mdash;just at the edge of
them woods. I took the cover off the stove and
the fire flashed out and showed me his face&mdash;just
as plain!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been dreaming,&#8221; said Laura, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out!&#8221; ejaculated Liz, with emphasis. &#8220;I
never fell asleep yet washin&#8217; greasy dishes&mdash;no,
Ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what it means,&#8221; Liz said, solemnly.
&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>does</i> it mean?&#8221; demanded Laura,
doubtful whether to laugh or be serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; said the odd girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should he appear to you, even if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
<i>were</i> dead?&#8221; demanded Laura, seeing that she
must never let this superstition take root in the
camp. &#8220;Do you suppose he&#8217;s come to try to
get his five dollars back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness to gracious!&#8221; said Liz. &#8220;No.
The ha&#8217;nt of a man that owned a bank wouldn&#8217;t
come to bother a poor gal like me for money,
would he?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE &#8220;KLEPTOMANIANTIC&#8221; GHOST</h3>
</div>
<p>The other girls crowded around then and
wanted to know what had happened. Laura
pinched Liz and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;She dropped those plates. Guess we won&#8217;t
make her pay for the broken ones, girls. Go on,
now. I&#8217;ll finish helping Liz wipe them.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the matter of the &#8220;ha&#8217;nt&#8221; did not become
public property just then. In fact, Mother Wit
talked so seriously to the maid-of-all-work that
she hoped the &#8220;ha&#8217;nt&#8221; had been laid, before they
sought their cots that night.</p>
<p>But in the morning there was a most surprising
sequel to the incident. The larder had been
robbed!</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be,&#8221; said Laura, who heard of the
trouble first of all when she popped out of the
sleeping tent. Lizzie Bean had awakened Mrs.
Morse and that lady&mdash;bundled in a blanket-robe&mdash;had
come to the cook-tent to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never walked in my sleep yet&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
knowed it,&#8221; stated Lizzie, with conviction. &#8220;And
there&#8217;s the things missin&#8217;&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>The remainder of the big ham, a strip of bacon,
coffee, sugar, syrup, canned milk, and half a sack
of flour were among the things which had disappeared.</p>
<p>While the three stood there, amazed, Bobby
came. &#8220;Bet it was those boys,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Playing
a joke on us. They&#8217;re over here somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun was just rising, and its early beams
shone on the camp across the lake. Laura ran
for the binoculars and examined the boys&#8217; camp.
Both powerboats were there, and the five canoes.
The boys were all disporting themselves in the
water&mdash;Laura could count the six.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they did it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they got back to
their camp very early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See this!&#8221; shrieked Bobby, suddenly.</p>
<p>She was pointing to the table, set as usual for
breakfast. Pinned to the red and white checked
table-cloth was a crisp ten dollar bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever robbed us paid for the goods,&#8221; Mrs.
Morse said, feebly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was that ha&#8217;nt!&#8221; declared Liz.</p>
<p>At that the story of the man&#8217;s face she had
seen at the edge of the wood the evening before,
came out. All the girls heard the story, and at
once there was a great hullabaloo!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A man on the island!&#8221; gasped Nellie. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;Liz says it&#8217;s a ghost.
A kleptomaniac ghost at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t be a kleptomaniac, Bobby,&#8221; said
Laura, laughing, &#8220;or he wouldn&#8217;t have left money
for the goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a kleptomani-<i>antic</i> ghost, then!&#8221; giggled
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;How ridiculous!&#8221; said Jess. &#8220;Whoever
heard the like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact remains,&#8221; said her mother, &#8220;that
some stranger has been here while we slept, and
taken the provisions&mdash;and we shall have to get
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ten dollars will more than pay for
what&#8217;s missing,&#8221; said Laura, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221; demanded Nellie. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like the idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lizzie was somewhat flurried. &#8220;And me&mdash;I
was sleepin&#8217; right behind that canvas curtain.
Not again! never! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this the girls all set up a wail. &#8220;Oh, Liz!
you mustn&#8217;t! You promised to stay! We&#8217;re paying
you good wages, Liz! Don&#8217;t leave us to do all
the work!&#8221; was the chorus of objections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to stay right here where
that ha&#8217;nt can get me,&#8221; declared Liz.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; put forth Laura, seriously, though her
eyes twinkled, &#8220;you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of <i>that</i>
haunt if he was such a nice young man as you say
he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grumbled Lizzie Bean, practically.
&#8220;No young man is nice after he&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>There seemed to be no answer to this statement.
But Mrs. Morse came to the rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bring your cot into the cabin, Lizzie,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You will not be afraid if you
sleep there with me, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Ma&#8217;am. I reckon not,&#8221; admitted the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about <i>us</i>?&#8221; cried Lil Pendleton.
&#8220;Surely, we won&#8217;t stay here if there are men on
the island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s big enough for them and us, too, I guess,&#8221;
said Bobby, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the man&mdash;or men&mdash;who stole our
food, is no longer on the island,&#8221; Laura said,
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they paid for it!&#8221; exclaimed Dora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Money isn&#8217;t everything,&#8221; said Nellie.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i>?&#8221; demanded Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our peace of mind,&#8221; declared the doctor&#8217;s
daughter, &#8220;is more important. I shall be afraid
to stay here if there are strange men on the
island.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll settle that,&#8221; Laura declared, with vigor,
&#8220;and at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; demanded Dorothy, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Search the island,&#8221; said practical Mother Wit.
&#8220;Certainly not by sitting down and sucking our
thumbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Laura!&#8221; wailed Lil. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
dare!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t dare what?&#8221; was Laura&#8217;s rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunt for those men on this island. Why! we
don&#8217;t <i>want</i> to find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d like to know why not? I don&#8217;t care
if they <i>did</i> leave money for the food they
took&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there must be something bad about
them&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we know that, Lil?&#8221; asked Laura.
&#8220;There is, rather, something <i>good</i> about them,
or they would not have left the money for the
stolen food.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Laura is right&mdash;as she almost always
is,&#8221; said Mrs. Morse, fondly. &#8220;A real thief at
heart would not have left that ten dollar bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you that chap was the nicest
one that lived at Missis Brayton&#8217;s boardin&#8217; house,&#8221;
put in Liz, reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;What chap?&#8221; cried Jess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The ha&#8217;nt,&#8221; said Liz, simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me, Lizzie!&#8221; said Laura, in some
disgust. &#8220;Don&#8217;t keep that up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then! If it wasn&#8217;t his ha&#8217;nt, it was
<i>himself</i>. Guess I know him,&#8221; declared the girl-of-all-work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell <i>me</i> about it, please?&#8221; said Jess&#8217; mother,
&#8220;You girls run and get your baths and we&#8217;ll get
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t want to leave the tent if there are
thieves about,&#8221; complained Lil, to whom the water
looked just as cold on this morning as it had the
day before. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ve got some jewelry in my
bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very foolish,&#8221; said Bobby, bluntly. &#8220;We
told you not to bring anything to camp that you
cared about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gently! gently!&#8221; said Laura, the peacemaker,
&#8220;Come on, Lil. Don&#8217;t be afraid of either the
kleptomaniantic thief, as Bobby calls him, or the
cold water&mdash;neither will hurt you, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had their plunge and that&mdash;or something
else&mdash;stirred Mother Wit&#8217;s &#8220;thinking machine.&#8221;
She said, as they trooped up to dress:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wig-wag the boys and bring them over.
They will help us search the island. Besides, we
shall need one of the powerboats to go for more
food. It seems funny that a man who was willing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
to pay for what he took&mdash;and pay so well&mdash;did
not go down to Elberon Crossing and buy at
the store just what he took from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an outlaw&mdash;a murderer, maybe, fleeing
for his life,&#8221; suggested Lil, tremblingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! so are you!&#8221; scoffed Jess. &#8220;More
than likely he is some lazy fisherman who did not
want to go to the store&mdash;some rich fellow from
the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Liz knows what she is talking about,&#8221; said
Laura, &#8220;it <i>is</i> a rich fellow from Albany. A Mr.
Norman. And she told me last night that he was
a great fisherman and hunter.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what under the sun,&#8221; demanded Bobby,
&#8220;should he take our food for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell me it is anything as simple as
that,&#8221; Lil Pendleton declared. &#8220;He is a thief,
just the same. And it as dangerous for us to be
on this island with him. Why! I wouldn&#8217;t stay
another night&mdash;unless the boys were here to defend
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! the cat is out of the bag,&#8221; chuckled
Bobby. &#8220;Lil wants Purt over here with his revolver,&#8221;
and then the other girls laughed and Lil
got mad again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE SEARCH OF THE ISLAND</h3>
</div>
<p>Laura dressed in a hurry and ran out with the
flags. She took a slip of paper with her on which
Chet had marked down the code, to refresh her
memory, and at once stood out upon a high
boulder and began to wave the &#8220;call flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without the glasses she could not see what the
boys were doing about their camp; but Jess came
with the best pair of binoculars, and soon told her
that the boys were evidently in much excitement.
Chet appeared with <i>his</i> flags, and brother and
sister carried on a silent conversation for some
ten minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, girls,&#8221; Laura said, seriously, when she
came down from the rock and led the way to the
breakfast table. &#8220;Chet assures me none of the
boys have been over here. They were coming
right after breakfast, anyway, and will come in
the powerboats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They know nothing about our loss, and Chet
is impressed with the seriousness of the affair. I
wouldn&#8217;t let him think we were scared at all, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
asked to borrow a boat so as to get more provisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I should say not!&#8221; exclaimed Jess.
&#8220;After what they said about our calling them,
when they left us the other night, we don&#8217;t want
to give then a chance to laugh at us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;ll go for the provisions to this Crossing
you speak of?&#8221; asked Nellie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a couple of the boys. The others will
help us search the island,&#8221; Laura said, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make out a list of what is needed, Laura,&#8221;
advised Mrs. Morse, as she retired to her typewriter.
&#8220;And be sure to get a bottle of peroxide.
It&#8217;s good for cuts, or mosquito bites, or any
poison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not long after breakfast the two powerboats,
the <i>Duchess</i> and the <i>Bonnie Lass</i>, were seen approaching.
All the boys had come, and they were
all very curious as to the raid that had been made
upon the girls&#8217; pantry.</p>
<p>Purt Sweet had seemingly been transformed in
the two days he had been &#8220;roughing it&#8221; in camp.
He still wore the green knickerbockers, and the
long stockings. The belt with its hunting-knife
scabbard, was about his waist. And there was
a suspicious bunch under his waistband that announced
the presence of the ancient revolver.</p>
<p>However, Purt&#8217;s mother would not have known
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
his clothing, so stained, torn and bedraggled did
his garments appear. The boys had made him do
his share of the camp work. Chopping wood had
made his palms blister, sparks had snapped out
of the fires he had made and burned holes in his
clothes, and hot fat snapping from the skillet had
left red marks on his hands and face.</p>
<p>Having fun in camp was the hardest work Purt
Sweet had ever done; but he was ashamed to
&#8220;kick&#8221; about it before the girls. He came ashore
to assure Lil Pendleton that he would do his best
to find and punish the marauders who had raided
the camp on the island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether the fellow paid for what he got, or
not,&#8221; Chet said, seriously, when he had heard the
particulars, &#8220;we want to know if he is still here,
and what he means by such actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must know that he <i>isn&#8217;t</i> here, or I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
want to stay,&#8221; declared Nellie Agnew, who was
really very timid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave it to us,&#8221; said Billy Long, grandly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll comb this island with a fine tooth
comb&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose we girls are going to let
you fellows do it all, do you?&#8221; demanded Laura.
&#8220;Of course we shall help, Short and Long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw! you&#8217;ll tear your frocks and scratch yourself
on the vines, and stub your toes and fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
down, and make a mess generally,&#8221; declared Short
and Long, loftily. &#8220;Better stay here in camp
and do your squealing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! I like that!&#8221; quoth Jess, making a
dive for the short boy. She was considerably
bigger than he, and catching him from the rear
she wound her long arms about him and so held
him tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that back, Short and Long,&#8221; she commanded,
&#8220;or I shall hold you prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Short and Long found he could not get away
from Jess, and finally stopped struggling. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know you thought so much of me, Jess,&#8221;
he said, grinning. &#8220;But it embarrasses me
dreadfully, to have you hug me in public.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; laughed the big girl, &#8220;I&#8217;d think no
more of hugging you, than I would your brother,
Tommy&mdash;and <i>he&#8217;s</i> a dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think so if you had that kid around all
the time,&#8221; grunted Short and Long, as Jess finally
allowed him to wriggle loose. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s
more of a terror than he is a dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He takes it from you, then,&#8221; laughed Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; said Lance, grinning, &#8220;it runs in
Billy&#8217;s family to be a cut-up&mdash;like wooden legs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Tommy been doing now?&#8221; asked
Dorothy Lockwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he is great chums with the kid next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
door, and they got into mischief of some kind the
other day. The other kid&#8217;s mother told them that
if they did such things &#8216;the bad man would get
them.&#8217; &#8216;Who&#8217;s the bad man, Tommy?&#8217; our Sue
asked him, and Tommy says:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t know. You&#8217;ll hafter ask Charlie&#8217;s
mother. She&#8217;s well acquainted with him.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, now!&#8221; exclaimed Lance. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
going to take the <i>Duchess</i> and go to Elberon
Crossing for this bill of goods? We can&#8217;t all go
hunting for robbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall stay here to help defend the girls,
doncher know,&#8221; stated Purt, swaggering about
the camp. &#8220;But any of you fellows can take my
boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spoken like a nobleman, Purt!&#8221; declared
Chet, laughing. &#8220;Come on, now! Let&#8217;s arrange
how we shall sweep the island, from shore to
shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>But first it was agreed that Lance and Reddy
should go with the <i>Duchess</i> for the new supply of
food for the girls. They set off at once.</p>
<p>The island was a quarter of a mile across at its
widest point. Even if the whole party entered
on the search they would have difficulty in making
so strong a human barrier across the isle that a
fugitive in the covert could not escape through
the line.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>But Chet occasionally had a bright idea as well
as his sister. He sent Short and Long&mdash;who
could climb like a squirrel&mdash;to the top of a tall
tree on the knoll. From that height he could see
every opening in the wood, to the upper point of
the island&mdash;which was nearly two miles long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll all go and beat up the brush and
see if we can start anything bigger than a rabbit,&#8221;
Chet declared. &#8220;Spread out and try to push
through the woods as straight as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We girls, too?&#8221; cried Nellie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be a sport, Nell, and come along,&#8221; urged Jess
Morse. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be in sight and call of each other
all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which was true enough, as they soon discovered.
Lil said it was her turn to help do the
camp work. And of course neither Mrs. Morse
nor Liz could go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; Purt asked, seriously,
&#8220;that one of us ought to remain here and defend&mdash;er&mdash;the
camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Chet, quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll leave Art,
if you say so. He rather admires Lil, too, Purt.&#8221;</p>
<p>This made the dude keep still; but he <i>did</i> dislike
this &#8220;manhunt&#8221; in the thick brush of Acorn
Island.</p>
<p>After they had gone half a mile or so, and
found nothing&mdash;not even a trace of anybody else
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
having camped on the island&mdash;they all took the
situation more cheerfully. They believed whoever
had stolen the girls&#8217; food had already departed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of these fancy city fishermen, like
enough,&#8221; Chet declared, when they all came together
at the western point of the island. &#8220;See
yonder! there are two men in a boat, fishing,
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they were the robbers they would not
boldly anchor off there,&#8221; his sister said.</p>
<p>&#8220;True enough, Laura,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;I believe
that whoever stole from us, is far away now.
And everybody who comes to the lake knows that
it is forbidden to camp on Acorn Island. The
guides all know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about what Liz says about the man she
saw last evening?&#8221; demanded Jess. &#8220;She says
he was a man she knew in Albany.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had been talking to me about him,&#8221;
laughed Laura, &#8220;and I guess he was in her mind.
Why should such a man come and rob our
camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! it&#8217;s a mystery,&#8221; Chet said. &#8220;But I
reckon you&#8217;ll not be bothered again; the island
seems empty save for ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>But later they thought that they might have
been a little more careful in searching the upper
end of Acorn Island.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;MORE FUN THAN A LITTLE&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>The girls were tired enough when they got
back from the search; and it being an hour before
dinner, Mrs. Morse advised them all to retire
to the sleeping tent and lie down.</p>
<p>However, it was too sultry for that, and they
chose to put on bathing suits and take a second
dip to cool off. The boys had their bathing suits,
too, and the party had twenty minutes of fun in
the lake, with Mrs. Morse sitting on a rock in the
shade and enjoying the pranks.</p>
<p>Lil&#8217;s bathing suit was very resplendent, and so
was Purt&#8217;s. They were so much better dressed
than anybody else that Bobby declared she was
ashamed to be seen in their company&mdash;so she dove
under the water.</p>
<p>The cut-up had the power of remaining beneath
the surface a long time, and she crawled on the
bottom to where Lil and Purt stood, waist deep
in the water, without being observed.</p>
<p>Suddenly Purt yelled, dropped Lil&#8217;s hand, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
grabbed at the calf of his right leg. &#8220;A crab&#8217;s
got me!&#8221; he bawled.</p>
<p>&#8220;A crab in fresh water?&#8221; jeered Billy Long.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a new one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of those horrid snapping turtles!&#8221;
shrieked Lil, and started for the shore. Not
quickly enough, however, to escape Bobby&#8217;s thumb
and finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that horrid Bobby Hargrew!&#8221; gasped
Lil, seeing the black-eyed one shoot up from beneath,
and take a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, Miss Hargrew!&#8221; begged Purt. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
bother us so. It&#8217;s weally too bad of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then act human!&#8221; ejaculated Bobby.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you two stand around as though you
were fashion pictures in the magazines. Duck
under and get your hair wet! You&#8217;ll both get a
sunstroke,&#8221; and in passing them she managed to
tip Lil right over backward&mdash;and that beautiful
bathing suit never <i>did</i> look as well after it was all
wet!</p>
<p>They had dinner before Lance and Reddy returned
from their errand. It had already been
agreed that the boys should stay all day at Acorn
Island and not return to their own camp until
after supper.</p>
<p>Occasionally one of them took a squint at the
camp across the lake through a pair of glasses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
But nothing disturbed <i>that</i> spot. Their tents were
erected in a clearing at the edge of the water, and
they knew there was not a human habitation on
that side of the lake within five miles.</p>
<p>Elberon Crossing was at the head of Rocky
River, but a good half mile from the water and
landing, where a &#8220;tote-road&#8221; went through the
Big Woods to the lumber camps farther west.</p>
<p>The <i>Duchess</i> was in sight of the girls&#8217; camp
all the way from the landing on the south side of
the river. On her return the party watched her
approach, which was soon after the noonday meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; ejaculated Chet, suddenly grabbing
up the glasses. &#8220;They have a passenger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who have?&#8221; queried Billy Long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance and Reddy. Crickey! who have we
here?&#8221; and then Chet began to laugh uproariously.</p>
<p>He tossed the glasses to Short and Long. The
latter looked at the motorboat for a moment, and
then began to laugh, too. Some of the girls became
interested, and they ran for their glasses.</p>
<p>There was a third moving figure in the boat.
It sat up forward and seemed to be gazing on the
island eagerly. The girls began to giggle as well
as Short and Long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; begged Laura. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>Purt and Lil were sitting together in the shade,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
and paid no attention to what was going on. Almost
everybody on the island but themselves
realized the identity of the third figure in the
<i>Duchess</i> before the boat neared the beach.</p>
<p>Suddenly Purt gasped, and sat up straighter.
He glanced all about and a sort of hunted expression
came into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Mr. Sweet?&#8221; demanded
Lil, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I thought I heard&mdash;Yes! I knew I could
not be mistaken,&#8221; said Purt, in horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter?&#8221; demanded his companion,
with some tartness. She did not like mysteries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I heard a dog bark,&#8221; stammered Purt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! what if you did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But on this&mdash;this island. Who&mdash;who could
have brought the howwid cweature here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not <i>that</i> dog, Purt!&#8221; gasped Lil, suddenly remembering.</p>
<p>There was a hail from the crew of the <i>Duchess</i>.
Again the sharp bark of a dog sounded.</p>
<p>Purt leaped to his feet. He glared down upon
the approaching motorboat. Then he glanced
around helplessly, as though tempted to run.</p>
<p>The Barnacle was fixed on his tail in the bow of
the approaching boat, barking for all he was
worth!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Purt!&#8221; yelled Lance, standing up in the
cockpit of the <i>Duchess</i> and bawling the news.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s your canine friend!&#8221;</p>
<p>Purt fairly groaned. Then he got mad and
forgetting the girls were present, he blackguarded
the jokers in the launch wrathfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush-aby! hush-aby, sonny!&#8221; begged
Bobby. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t do all that to Lance and
poor little Reddy&mdash;would you really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get square with them!&#8221; stammered the
dude, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll kill that dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you bite him,&#8221; warned Short and Long,
&#8220;for if you do right now he will sure have the
hydrophobia. Take it easy, Purt&mdash;cool and
easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the dude could not. The very sight of that
laughing, ragged-coated dog made his blood boil.
He hunted a club with which to meet the brute
when he landed.</p>
<p>But Lance explained about the Barnacle before
the <i>Duchess</i> came close enough for them to land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, there he was ready to meet us at the
Elberon store,&#8221; laughed Lance. &#8220;I found out
that everybody along the Big Woods trails knows
the mongrel. He had come up yesterday with a
tote-team which was going into the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;He welcomed Reddy and me as if we were his
long-lost brothers. But it&#8217;s Purt he wants to see&mdash;believe
me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix him!&#8221; threatened the dude, from the
shore, and waving a club.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; begged Lance. &#8220;I have a better
idea than that. I didn&#8217;t bring the Barnacle along
to be slaughtered to make a Sweet holiday&mdash;no,
sir! What do you think about leaving him at the
island here with the girls, Chet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great! he&#8217;ll guard the camp,&#8221; declared
Laura&#8217;s brother. &#8220;Nobody else will come around
to steal grub.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idee, Mister,&#8221; said Liz, from
the cook-tent. &#8220;The dog is wuth more than any
boy to watch for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear that, will you?&#8221; demanded Chet.
&#8220;You girls have one fine suffragette in this Lonesome
Liz, as Billy calls her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s ripe for battle, when it comes to pitting
the ladies against the mere male,&#8221; laughed Laura.
&#8220;We have found <i>that</i> out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Against Purt&#8217;s objections the Barnacle was allowed
to come ashore. And the poor beast <i>did</i>
seem so delighted to be among them again that
they had not the heart to treat him badly. At
least, nobody hated him save Lily and Purt.</p>
<p>Barnacle was fed hugely by Liz Bean, and had
to lie down after it and sleep. So he did not disturb
Purt during the afternoon.</p>
<p>The girls had agreed to get supper all by themselves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
Liz and Mrs. Morse were to have nothing
to do with it.</p>
<p>Bobby and Laura made cake. There were
chickens to roast&mdash;two pairs of them&mdash;that Lance
had thoughtfully bought of a woman at the Crossing.
These were handed over to the tender
mercies of Jess and Nell.</p>
<p>Now, Jess was a good cook; she did most of
the housework at the Morse cottage. But when
they had had chicken, the butcher always cleaned
the creature before sending it home.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; sniffed Nell. &#8220;What do you
know about taking a chicken apart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;not much, I am afraid,&#8221; admitted Jess,
&#8220;And here are four of them! Well, we ought to
learn a good deal about it by the time we have
butchered all four.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh! I don&#8217;t want to cut into them. And
some of their insides are the delicacies of the
chicken, while other parts are no good. Do you
know one from the other, Jess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I know the giblets&mdash;if I can once
get at them,&#8221; said Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother and I took our sewing machine to
pieces once, and fixed it,&#8221; Nellie said, &#8220;and that
was pretty complicated. But we had a book of
instructions&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t issue a book of instructions with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
a roasting chicken,&#8221; Jess chuckled. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to
us, I expect&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she called Lance. They had to admit a
boy <i>was</i> good for something once in a while.
Lance knew all about cleaning and drawing chickens,
and he did <i>that</i> part of the work very neatly
and with dispatch.</p>
<p>It being such warm weather the girls made
dressing enough to stuff only two of the chickens.
They got on bravely with their share of the work
and were ready to put the chickens in the oven in
the big dripping-pan when Laura&#8217;s and Bobby&#8217;s
cakes were done.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Reddy and Short and Long had
been very busy with the ice-cream freezer. The
boys had brought over a can of milk and a big
block of ice from the landing and Mrs. Morse
had made the ice-cream. The boys froze it and
packed it down in the shade.</p>
<p>Everybody began to get hungry early, for the
odors from the cook-tent had been most delicious.
As soon as the chickens and the baked potatoes
were done, supper was served. Liz, in a clean
dress and a clean apron served it.</p>
<p>Everything was fine except the chicken stuffing.
There was something just a little queer
about <i>that</i>; but what it was nobody seemed able
to tell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know I seasoned it with that same prepared
seasoning of herbs that we use at home,&#8221; wailed
Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have left something out,&#8221; said Nellie,
despairingly.</p>
<p>Chet was tasting the dressing critically. &#8220;No,&#8221;
he said, without a smile. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you
could have done <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jess brightened visibly. &#8220;Then it doesn&#8217;t taste
so bad?&#8221; she said, hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing you could have left <i>out</i>, Jess,
that would make it taste like this. It&#8217;s something
you&#8217;ve put in&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz suddenly presented herself at the table shaking
a box in her hand. &#8220;Was <i>this</i> what you took
for seasonin&#8217; for that stuffin&#8217;?&#8221; she demanded,
solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes,&#8221; admitted Jess. &#8220;That&#8217;s the very
box I always buy it in at our grocer&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; said Liz. &#8220;It comes in that. But
that&#8217;s an old box I&#8217;ve had a long time, and there
was lic&#8217;rish powder in it. I guess &#8217;twon&#8217;t hurt
none o&#8217; yer; but I wouldn&#8217;t eat much o&#8217; that
stuffin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; murmured Jess, as the laughter
broke out. &#8220;I <i>thought</i> that stuff smelt kind of
funny when I shook it out of the can.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE BARNACLE HAS A NOSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Aside from that single mistake the meal was
declared to be a great success. The cake turned
out a joy, and when it and the heaping dishes of
ice-cream were brought on, the boys stood up and
gave three cheers for the girls of Acorn Island
Camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;But hold on!&#8221; exclaimed Chet, suddenly investigating
his share of the ice-cream with a
spoon. &#8220;I have been given a premium with my
supply. Here! who has lost a perfectly good
fly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alive?&#8221; demanded his chum, Lance.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can still crawl,&#8221; admitted Chet.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fly&#8217;s a perfect idiot,&#8221; declared Lance,
warmly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the same one that was in the hot
gravy a little while ago. I hope he takes a chill.
What does he think this is&mdash;a turkish bath?&#8221;</p>
<p>They lingered long at the table, until finally
Liz (who had agreed to &#8220;clean up&#8221;) drove them
all out of the tent. They finished the ice-cream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
(which Reddy and Short and Long declared <i>had</i>
to be eaten up because there was not ice enough
to keep it out in the open), with the light fading
out of the western sky and the early fireflies flitting
about the edge of the wood.</p>
<p>The Barnacle began to bark vociferously, all of
a sudden. Lizzie, up at the lighted cook-tent,
squealed.</p>
<p>Up rose the boys with a great whoop. &#8220;Go for
it!&#8221; yelled Lance. &#8220;Sick &#8217;im!&#8221; which seems to
be the approved way to set a dog on anything
living.</p>
<p>Barnacle was barking his foolish head off. He
dashed across from the cook-tent to the woods,
and then back again. The boys all urged him on.
The girls ran together in a frightened group, Lil
moaning:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s here again! that dreadful man is here
again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush you!&#8221; commanded Liz, in disgust.
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no man. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t even a ha&#8217;nt. I seen
it. It&#8217;s a black and white kitten&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Chet! call him off! call him off!&#8221; begged
Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Chet!&#8221; added Jess. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let that
horrid dog hurt that kitty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chetwood!&#8221; shrieked Laura again, knowing
more about the inhabitants of the woods than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
her chum. &#8220;Chetwood! Stop it! Come back!
That&#8217;s <i>a polecat</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What</i>?&#8221; gasped all the girls, and then Bobby
began to shriek with laughter. It was too, too
funny&mdash;with Jess begging the boys not to let the
Barnacle hurt &#8220;kitty.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was impossible, however, to call the dog off
the trail. That camp scavenger, the American
skunk, is the mildest mannered little creature in
the world&mdash;providing he is left strictly alone.
Being timid and otherwise defenseless, God has
given him a scent-sack which&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody can tell me that the skunk only
brought a <i>cent</i> into the Ark,&#8221; declared the exhausted
Bobby. &#8220;That fellow has a dollar&#8217;s
worth himself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why did the Creator ever <i>make</i> such
a horrid beast?&#8221; demanded Lil.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ask that and wear those furs of yours in
the winter?&#8221; said Nellie, laughing. &#8220;The pretty
little fellow that the Barnacle has so unwisely
chased away from our vicinity is becoming very
valuable to the furriers. There are people who
raise the creatures for the market&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse <i>me</i>!&#8221; gasped Bobby. &#8220;I&#8217;d want a
chronic cold in the head, if I had to work on a
skunk farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Barnacle and his quarry went farther from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
the camp the odor that had risen drifted away,
too; but for two days thereafter the girls could
easily tell in which part of the island Barnacle
was running game, by the way in which the odor
came &#8220;down wind&#8221; to them.</p>
<p>Liz fed him at the edge of the wood; the girls
chased him from the vicinity of the tents whenever
he appeared.</p>
<p>The Barnacle did not mind much; for he had
struck a dog-hunter&#8217;s paradise. He was a fiend
after small game and there had not been a dog on
Acorn Island for some years, in all probability.</p>
<p>He was running and yapping all day and pretty
nearly all night. How many groundhogs, chipmunks,
muskrats, coons, and other small animals,
besides the rabbits, he chased and caught there
was no telling. Perhaps he did not kill one.</p>
<p>But he barked to his heart&#8217;s desire and when he
finally had driven everything to cover, he came
back to the tents, purified in soul as well as in
odor, and was willing to sleep during the day and
sit up on his haunches at night (when they tied
him to the corner of the cabin) and try to howl
his head off at the moon.</p>
<p>The girls&mdash;even Lil and Nellie&mdash;lost their fear
of a second visit from the mysterious &#8220;kleptomaniantic.&#8221;
Nobody would land upon the island
to disturb them while that crazy dog was about.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>So they fished, and swam, and picked berries,
and hunted flowers and herbs, and went out sailing
with the boys in the powerboats, and drove
their canoes up and down the lake, having a fine
time every hour of the day.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse got on famously with her book,
and allowed the girls to do about as they liked.
They got into no mischief, however; but they all
grew brown, and strong, and even Lily began to
put on flesh.</p>
<p>At this season there were few fishermen at
Lake Dunkirk. Some days there were long processions
of barges sailing past the island, making
for Rocky River and the ports down stream.
And sometimes puffy tugs drew other barges
westward, against the current.</p>
<p>None of the crews of these boats disturbed the
campers. Acorn Island had been placarded for
years, and it had always been necessary to get a
permit to have even a picnic there.</p>
<p>Just one couple of fishermen came within range
of the girls&#8217; vision that first week or ten days.
And that couple, in their clumsy canoe, were never
near enough for the girls of Central High to see
their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where <i>they</i> camp at night?&#8221; said
Laura thoughtfully one evening as she and Jess
were paddling in for supper, being the last of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
scattered girls to make camp. She had sighted
the strange fishermen off the western end of
Acorn Island again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet they are the fellows who took our food!&#8221;
exclaimed Jess, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And have hung about here all this time?
Nonsense!&#8221; returned Laura. &#8220;But don&#8217;t let Lil
and Nellie hear you say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. But I bet they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more worried by that cloud yonder,&#8221; said
Laura. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a tempest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope not till supper&#8217;s over,&#8221; said the hungry
Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll peg down the tents to make sure as soon
as we get in,&#8221; said the careful Laura.</p>
<p>They did so. Half through supper the first
drops of the storm fell. Then the thunder rolled
nearer and a tall tree was riven on the mainland,
within sight of Camp Acorn.</p>
<p><i>That</i> pretty well settled the supper for most of
the girls. Even the bravest had never experienced
a thunder storm under canvas before.</p>
<p>So they all ran into Mrs. Morse&#8217;s cabin. It did
not seem so bad there.</p>
<p>In the midst of the downpour, however, and in
a lull between thunder claps, Barnacle, who had
been tied to the corner of the hut and had crawled
under the floor for protection, suddenly broke out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
with a terrific salvo of barks. He rushed out into
the rain and leaped at the end of his rope, barking
and yelping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s about the camp,&#8221; murmured Mrs.
Morse. &#8220;The dog&#8217;s nose&mdash;if not his eyes&mdash;tells
him so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Liz,&#8221; ventured Jess, for the maid-of-all-work
had not come with them to the cabin.</p>
<p>Laura threw the door open, in spite of the flashing
lightning. Lil shrieked and even some of the
other girls cowered as the lightning played across
the sky. But before the thunder burst forth again,
Laura heard another sound&mdash;and it was not the
Barnacle baying.</p>
<p>Lizzie Bean, in the cook-tent, was screaming in
a queer and stifled way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>WHERE THE BARNACLE&#8217;S NOSE LED HIM</h3>
</div>
<p>The rain descended in torrents before the cabin
door. E&#8217;er Laura could plunge into it, Jess
dragged her back and slammed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a goose, Laura!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;she&#8211;&#8211;Something is the matter with
Liz,&#8221; declared Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, I heard her. And there&#8217;s the dog
barking again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go through that rain&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; declared Laura, and she wrenched
open the door once more. Jess could not hold
her. Mother Wit plunged out into the storm.</p>
<p>Never having deserted her chum but once&mdash;and
then involuntarily at a certain occasion long ago&mdash;Jess
was not going to be behind now. She dove
likewise into the storm.</p>
<p>The rain beat upon the two girls in a fashion to
almost take their breath away. Never had they
been so beaten by the elements.</p>
<p>They staggered, almost fell, clung together,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
and then bent their heads to the downpour and
pressed on. The flickering lantern still illuminated
the cook-tent. The awning was dropped
and the canvas heaved and slatted against the
poles.</p>
<p>The rain made so much noise that they did not
hear Liz now. Or else, she had ceased crying out.
Laura and Jess pressed forward and&mdash;it being
but a few yards, after all, to the tent&mdash;they burst
into the kitchen in a moment more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz! Liz!&#8221; gasped Laura, almost breathless.</p>
<p>There was a noise behind the fluttering canvas
partition. Was it the girl in the sleeping part of
the tent?</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! somebody&#8217;s there!&#8221; muttered Jess, clinging
to her chum&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>Laura sprang forward and jerked apart the
flap. She only feared that something was the
matter with Liz.</p>
<p>And there was, apparently. She was crouching
down, against the far wall of the tent, her
hands over her face, and trembling like a leaf.</p>
<p>Afterward Laura thought over this scene with
wonder. Lonesome Liz did not seem like a girl
who would be so terribly disturbed about a thunder
storm. She had shown no fear when the
tempest began and the other girls had scampered
for the cabin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>But now she was moaning, and rocking herself
to and fro, and it was some moments before they
could get a sensible word out of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! oh! oh!&#8221; wailed Liz. &#8220;I want to go
back to town. I don&#8217;t like this place a little bit&mdash;no,
I don&#8217;t! Oh, oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop your noise, Liz!&#8221; exclaimed Jess, suddenly
exasperated. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go back while it
is storming so. And when it stops you won&#8217;t
want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Laura was worried. She looked all about
the tent. What had the Barnacle barked so about?</p>
<p>Nor was he satisfied now. The storm held up
after a time; but the dog kept rushing out and
barking as though he had just remembered that
there had been a prowler about, and he had not
had a chance to chase him.</p>
<p>Laura understood that rain, or wet, killed the
scent for dogs and like trailing animals. This
that had disturbed the Barnacle must have been a
person who had come very close.</p>
<p>They took Liz to the cabin, and left her there
after the storm was over and the six Central High
girls went to their own tent. But although Laura
did not say much about it, she was as dissatisfied
as the dog seemed to be.</p>
<p>In the morning she was up earlier than anybody
else in the camp. The grass and brush was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
drenched with the rain. There were puddles here
and there. The sun was not yet up and it would
take several hours of his best work to dry up the
wet places.</p>
<p>Laura had not won her nickname of &#8220;Mother
Wit&#8221; for nothing. She had inventiveness;
likewise she had a sane and sensible way of looking
at almost any mysterious happening. She did
not get scared as Nellie did, or ignore a surprising
thing, as Jess did.</p>
<p>Now she was dissatisfied with the outcome of
Liz Bean&#8217;s &#8220;conniption,&#8221; as Bobby had termed
it the evening before. The maid-of-all-work had
shown no fear of thunder and lightning when the
tempest began and the other girls were frightened.</p>
<p>Then, why should she wait until the storm was
nearly over before showing all the marks of extreme
terror? And, in addition, Liz seemed to be
fairly speechless about the matter, whereas she
was naturally an extremely garrulous person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did the Barnacle bark so?&#8221; demanded
Laura, when she stood, shivering, in the gray light
of dawn before the cook-tent. &#8220;Not just for the
fun of hearing his own voice, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ground before the cook-tent was soft,
and trampled by the girls&#8217; own feet. Laura went
carefully around to the rear, stepping on firm
ground so as to leave no marks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>There was a rear opening to the cook-tent&mdash;out
of the part Liz had been sleeping in. But these
flaps were laced down.</p>
<p>However, there were marks in the soft ground
right here&mdash;footmarks that could not be mistaken.
They were prints of a man&#8217;s boot&mdash;no girl in the
crowd wore such footgear as those that made
these marks!</p>
<p>The boot-prints led right from the laced flaps
of the tent toward the woods. Laura could see
fully a dozen of the marks, all headed that way.
The man had come from the inside of the tent,
for there were no footprints showing an approach
to the tent from this end.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that girl did not cry because of the
thunder and lightning,&#8221; was Laura&#8217;s decision.
&#8220;This man burst into the tent while she was
alone. And for some reason she is afraid to tell
us the truth about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, she hasn&#8217;t really told a falsehood.
She just let us believe that it was the storm that
had scared her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, who is the man? Is she sheltering him
because of fear, or for another reason?</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did he want? Why did he come to
the tent in the storm? For shelter from the rain?
Not probable. I declare!&#8221; thought Mother Wit,
&#8220;this is as puzzling a thing as ever I heard.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>She said nothing to anybody before breakfast
about her discoveries. She did not wish to disturb
Mrs. Morse, for that lady had come into the
woods for a rest from her social duties, and for
the writing of a book. Why should she be
troubled by a mere mystery?</p>
<p>The detective fever burned hotly in Laura Belding&#8217;s
veins on this morning. From Jess she could
not keep her discovery for long; but she swore
her chum to silence.</p>
<p>Then she took Bobby Hargrew into her confidence.
Despite the younger girl&#8217;s recklessness,
she was brave and physically strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to run down Lizzie&#8217;s &#8216;ha&#8217;nt,&#8217; if
the Barnacle has a nose,&#8221; declared Laura, after
the trio had discussed the pros and cons of the
affair.</p>
<p>So they loosened the dog, Laura holding him in
leash, and slipped away to the woods when none
of the other members of the party were watching.
Laura knew that the scent would not lie very
strong after the pelting rain; but they could follow
the trail by sight for a long distance.</p>
<p>It led straight toward the far end of Acorn
Island&mdash;the end which they and the boys had so
carelessly searched the day after the larder had
been robbed. Here and there they came upon the
print of the unknown man&#8217;s boots in the softened
soil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, Laura!&#8221; gasped Bobby. &#8220;Suppose he
turns on us? We don&#8217;t know whether he is a
robber or a minister. What will we do when we
find him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends altogether upon what he looks
like,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;Now hush, Bobby. The
Barnacle is pulling hard; he really smells something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it isn&#8217;t another black and white kitten,&#8221;
chuckled Bobby.</p>
<p>They went down a slope to a small hollow, well
sheltered by trees and rocks. There was a faint
odor of wood smoke in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;A camp,&#8221; whispered Jess, having hard work
to keep her teeth from nervously chattering,
despite the heat of the day, &#8220;Who do you suppose
is here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; whispered Laura in return, and
slipped the dog&#8217;s leash.</p>
<p>The Barnacle ran down into the dale at once.
The three girls followed, cautiously parting the
branches. They came in sight of the fire.</p>
<p>It was the remains of a late breakfast-fire, without
doubt. There was a single figure sitting at
one side of the smoldering wood. Barnacle was
running about the encampment, snuffing eagerly
for broken bits. He paid the figure by the fire no
attention, nor did the man look at the dog.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>The man stooped, and his face was buried in
his hands. He wore a shabby frock coat, and a
disreputable hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of those two fishermen we saw in
the canoe,&#8221; whispered Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder if you&#8217;re right?&#8221; breathed Bobby.</p>
<p>Just then the man raised his head and turned so
that the three girls from Central High could see
his face. It was unshaven and the man looked altogether
like a tramp. But there was no mistaking
him for anybody but Professor Dimp, the
Latin and history instructor of Central High!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A PERFECTLY UNSATISFACTORY INTERVIEW</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Goodness gracious!&#8221; gasped Bobby, the
first to find her breath. She fell limply against
Laura and Jess. &#8220;What do you know about
<i>that</i>? Say, girls! Do you see the same thing I
do, or am I going crazy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; commanded Jess, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous, child,&#8221; advised Laura,
rather sharply. &#8220;He will hear you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will that be a crime?&#8221; demanded Bobby, still
in a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said Laura, slowly. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
know why the professor is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To commune with nature, I judge,&#8221; said Jess,
drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine Old Dimple communing with
nature&mdash;not as a pastime,&#8221; giggled Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;He surely has some good reason for being
here,&#8221; Laura murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t accuse him of robbing the camp
that time, I suppose?&#8221; asked Jess. &#8220;Or being up
there last evening in the storm?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That trail came this way,&#8221; declared Bobby,
suddenly forgetting to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barnacle&#8217;s nose might have deceived him,&#8221;
said Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t faith in much of that dog <i>but</i> his
nose,&#8221; declared Jess. &#8220;He showed particular intelligence
in following the trail down here. Why
should we suddenly suspect him of being foolish,
just because we found what we didn&#8217;t expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear as mud!&#8221; exclaimed Bobby. &#8220;&#8216;Didn&#8217;t
expect&#8217; is good, however. If you had asked me a
minute before we saw him, who was the most
unexpected person to find at the end of our walk,
I should have said Old Dimple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; gasped Jess, &#8220;it <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> be Professor
Dimp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean he couldn&#8217;t have been the kleptomaniantic
thief?&#8221; chuckled Bobby.</p>
<p>Laura began to laugh softly herself. &#8220;Nor
could he have been the person we&mdash;and the Barnacle&mdash;have
been trailing,&#8221; she said, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Jess and Bobby together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever notice Professor Dimp&#8217;s feet?&#8221;
asked Mother Wit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horrors! No. Never saw him barefooted,&#8221;
said Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Smartie! His shoes, then?&#8221; proceeded
the unruffled Laura.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;Why, no,&#8221; admitted Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at them now. He&#8217;s not a big man, but
he has plentiful understandings,&#8221; chuckled Laura.
&#8220;See?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plain!&#8221; exclaimed Jess, peering through the
branches.</p>
<p>&#8220;And those footprints we followed were of a
person who wears a narrow, small boot. Small
for a man, I mean. I don&#8217;t believe the old Prof.
ever <i>could</i> get into such shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Mother Wit&mdash;the lady detective!&#8221;
cheered Bobby, under her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to ask him&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; demanded Jess, half frightened as
Laura started to press through the fringe of
bushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he knows anything about that young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What young man?&#8221; demanded the startled
Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young man who scared Liz last evening
in the storm. The same young man who took the
things from our camp&mdash;and left the ten dollar
bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The kleptomaniantic!&#8221; breathed Bobby, tagging
close behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s the man who has been fishing with
the professor?&#8221; gasped Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve guessed it,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;They are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
together. This is a camp for two. You can see
the fish-heads lying about. There are two tin-plates
and two empty cups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure the&mdash;the old Prof was one
of those fishermen we saw in the boat?&#8221; asked
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I recognize that old coat and hat,&#8221; said Laura,
firmly. &#8220;I do not see why I did not recognize
Professor Dimp, in spite of his disguise, before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; sighed Jess. &#8220;I am thankful one of
our fellow-inhabitants of the island is nobody
worse than Professor Dimp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>why</i>?&#8221; demanded Bobby, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find out what it means,&#8221; said Laura,
with more confidence than she really felt. Of
course, she was not afraid of any physical violence.
But the old professor was so terribly stern
and strict that it took some courage to walk across
the glade, where Barnacle was chewing fish-heads,
and face the shabby old gentleman.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, what, what?&#8221; snapped Professor
Dimp, rising up from the log on which he had
been sitting. &#8220;Girls from Central High, eh?
Ha! Miss Belding&mdash;yes; Miss Morse&mdash;yes; Miss
Hargrew&mdash;yes. Well! what do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed grayer than ever. His outing in
the woods (if he had been here ever since school
broke up) had done him little good, for he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
wrinkled and troubled looking. His thin lips actually
trembled as he greeted the three girls in characteristic
manner. His eyes, however, were as
bright as ever&mdash;like steel points. He looked this
way when the boys had been a trial to him in
Latin class and he was about to say something
very sharp.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are sorry to disturb you, Professor
Dimp,&#8221; said Laura, bravely. &#8220;But we are in a
quandary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A quandary, Miss Belding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Our dog has been following a man
who came to our camp last night and frightened
us. The dog led us right here to this spot. Have
you seen him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen the dog?&#8221; demanded the old professor.
&#8220;Do you think I am blind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean the man,&#8221; said Laura, humbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he look like? Describe him,&#8221;
commanded the professor, without a change of
expression.</p>
<p>Laura was balked right at the start. She had
no idea what the young man looked like, whom
she believed Liz Bean knew, and whom she believed
had come to the camp at the other end of
Acorn Island twice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know what his boots are like,&#8221; she said,
finally, and looking straight into the old professor&#8217;s
face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think <i>you</i> can supply the rest of his description,&#8221;
said Mother Wit, firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Miss?&#8221; snapped the old
professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wore narrow boots, and his footprints
lead directly to this place,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;Surely
you must have seen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; demanded the professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you have had a companion here.
Two men made this camp&mdash;have eaten more than
one meal here. Where is your companion, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss&mdash;Miss Belding!&#8221; exclaimed the professor
in a tone of anger. &#8220;How dare you? What
do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to offend you, sir,&#8221; said Mother
Wit, while Jess tugged at her sleeve and even
Bobby stepped back toward the fringe of brush.
The old gentleman looked very terrible indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to offend you, sir,&#8221; repeated
Laura. &#8220;But that man has been twice to our
camp. He has disturbed us. He was there again
last night and frightened our little maid-of-all-work
almost out of her wits. We have got to
know what it means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are beside yourself, girl!&#8221; gasped the old
gentleman, and instantly turned his head aside so
that they could not see his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Liz calls him &#8216;Mr. Norman,&#8217;&#8221; Laura pursued.
&#8220;If you do not tell me who he is, and what his
visits to our camp mean, I shall find out more
about him&mdash;<i>in Albany</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Dimp did not favor them with another
word. He walked away and left the trio
of girls standing, amazed, in the empty camping
place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>AN EVENTFUL FISHING TRIP</h3>
</div>
<p>Jess and Bobby were both disappointed and
disturbed over the interview with Professor
Dimp. Laura said so little about it that Jess was
really suspicious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see through it?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;What do you think the Dimple means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea,&#8221; said her chum,
frankly.</p>
<p>But there was another thought which Laura
Belding was not so frank about. She spoke of
this to neither Jess nor Bobby.</p>
<p>They agreed, as they went back toward their
camp, with Barnacle, that they would take nobody
into their confidence about the professor
being up here at Lake Dunkirk, fishing. Suspicious
circumstances had attached themselves to
the old gentleman&#8217;s presence here; yet the girls
could not believe that Professor Dimp had anything
to do with the raid on their larder, or the
frightening of Liz Bean the evening previous.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>However, Laura took Liz aside when they arrived
at the camp and endeavored to get the truth
out of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liz,&#8221; she said to the sad-faced girl, who
seemed gloomier than ever on this morning, &#8220;who
was the man who scared you in the rain last
evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid-of-all-work did not look startled.
Perhaps she had nerved herself already for just
this question.</p>
<p>She merely stared at Laura unblinkingly and
asked. &#8220;What, Ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pretend that you don&#8217;t know what I
mean, Liz,&#8221; said Laura, impatiently. &#8220;I found
the man&#8217;s tracks and the Barnacle found his camp
for us. The man came right into this tent last
evening in all that storm, and you let him out at
the back and laced down the flaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, there was no harm in it. And
there may be no harm in the man himself, or his
reason for being here on Acorn Island.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the girls hear of it&mdash;all of them, I
mean&mdash;they are going to be scared again, and it
will break up our outing and spoil all our fun.
Now! I want to know what it means, Liz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mean nothin&#8217;,&#8221; declared the girl, sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, <i>that</i> is no answer,&#8221; cried Laura.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then there ain&#8217;t none,&#8221; said Liz, shrugging
her narrow shoulders, and she turned to her work
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You absolutely refuse to talk to me about
him?&#8221; demanded Laura, rather vexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; to say,&#8221; muttered Lizzie
Bean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll find out about him in some other
way. It is that Mr. Norman you spoke about
before&mdash;I am sure of <i>that</i>. And I shall write to
Albany and learn why he is up here and what he is
doing. Of one thing I am sure: he has no business
on this island frightening the girls. The island
is private property and is posted.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Liz was at all frightened by this threat, she
did not show it. And, to tell the truth, it was an
empty threat. Laura Belding did not know whom
to write to in the city. She did not know the address
at which Liz had worked there, and at which
the mysterious Mr. Norman had been a boarder.</p>
<p>Some of the boys came over that afternoon and
arranged with the girls of Acorn Island Camp
to go fishing up the lake the next day. There
was a certain creek, which came in from the north
side, that was supposed to be well stocked with
perch and trout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of it is posted, I believe,&#8221; said Chet.
&#8220;Some old grouch owns a fishing right on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
stream. But we can keep off his territory. And
we&#8217;ll show you girls how to fish with a fly, and to
use your reels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teach us how to fish with mosquitoes&mdash;they&#8217;re
more plentiful than flies since the rain,&#8221;
Jess said, slapping at one which was just presenting
his bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crackey!&#8221; exclaimed Billy Long. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got it good here. There are not many of the
beasts on this island. But there&#8217;s a swamp not
far behind our camp, and it&#8217;s a shame to call the
things that come from that swamp, mosquitoes&mdash;they
are more like flying tigers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the old sabre-toothed tiger, of our
prehistoric days, was no more savage than these
swamp fly-by-nights,&#8221; Chet laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you have any other visitors over yonder?&#8221;
Laura asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, say! we had some this morning. Did you
hear the hounds baying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hounds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Real bloodhounds,&#8221; said her brother.
&#8220;Sheriff&#8217;s posse&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; gasped Laura, clapping a hand over
his mouth. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any sense at all?
Want to scare Lil and Nellie out of their next five
years&#8217; growth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; muttered Chet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shut Billy off, too. And then come and tell
me all about it,&#8221; commanded Laura.</p>
<p>Chet grabbed Billy by the collar and dragged
him away from the girls. Then, after whispering
to the smaller boy, emphatically, for a minute, he
let him go and rejoined his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what do you want to know, Sis?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;All about it,&#8221; said Laura, eagerly. &#8220;Is there
really a sheriff&#8217;s posse hunting him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s who?&#8221; asked Chet, in much amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;whoever they are chasing,&#8221; replied
Laura, rather blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just curiosity?&#8221; Chet wanted to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can call it that,&#8221; responded the girl, smiling
whimsically at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never were just idly curious in all your
life,&#8221; declared Chet, grinning at her. &#8220;Well! the
men were after that fellow who stole from the
Merchants and Miners Bank of Albany.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They got wind of his being up this way.
Somebody saw him, or thought he did. Crackey!
Do you suppose <i>he</i> was the fellow who took the
food from your tent, Laura?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; admitted his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s far enough away from the lake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
now,&#8221; said Chet, nodding. &#8220;That amount would
have lasted him till he got over the Canadian border.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;At any rate, those
dogs won&#8217;t be able to follow his trail much after
the hard rain of last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure not,&#8221; Chet rejoined. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the
sheriff said. He got us to promise to let him
know at Creeper Station if we saw anybody who
looked like Norman Halliday&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; gasped Laura, clapping her hands
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s &#8216;it?&#8217;&#8221; demanded her brother, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;His name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is. The fellow who stole the
securities from the bank. They will get him of
course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With bloodhounds? How terrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. They are muzzled. And friendly
brutes, at that. They only follow the scent they
are put on, and probably would do their quarry
no harm, even if they were unmuzzled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it seems terrible, just the same,&#8221; murmured
Laura. Then she added: &#8220;Suppose he
was somebody <i>we</i> had an interest in, Chet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! that <i>would</i> be tough. But he isn&#8217;t.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, promise me something,&#8221; urged
Laura, clinging to his shoulder with both hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Sis?&#8221; asked Chet, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t</i> tell the sheriff if you should run across
the poor young man. Don&#8217;t tell anybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sis!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a reason. I can&#8217;t tell you what it is,&#8221;
Laura said, half sobbing. &#8220;Will you mind me,
Chet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know!&#8221; declared her
brother, heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;And without asking questions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s putting a bit of a strain on me,&#8221;
laughed Chet. &#8220;But I know you must have a
good reason, Sis. Only remember, when you
want help, you haven&#8217;t any friend like your own
&#8216;buddy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, dear,&#8221; said Laura, kissing him.
&#8220;You are the best brother who ever lived!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was all &#8220;on the side.&#8221; When they rejoined
the others, neither Chet nor Laura revealed
any particular emotion. The girls all promised
to be ready for the fishing trip an hour after daybreak
on the following morning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, everything at Acorn Island went
on as usual. Liz Bean seemed no more morose
than before. Mrs. Morse was much too busy to
notice small things. She had half-heartedly offered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
to accompany the girls and boys to Bang-up
Creek for the fishing; but they had all assured
her that it would be unnecessary.</p>
<p>Instead, they were to come home by mid-afternoon
and all have supper at the island. The boys
brought over a part of their own provisions, when
they arrived in the bigger motorboat soon after
sun-up.</p>
<p>Purt Sweet was the only boy who did not have
a smile on; he looked gloomy indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely he isn&#8217;t afraid of the Barnacle, is
he?&#8221; queried Dora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about <i>him</i>,&#8221; said Dorothy.
&#8220;He&#8217;s tied up, anyway, so as not to follow us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you think that dog can follow us,
when we&#8217;re going ten miles by boat?&#8221; demanded
Reddy Butts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but the Barnacle would sprout
wings and fly through the air after Purt,&#8221; giggled
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the dog this time that troubles Purt&mdash;deah
boy!&#8221; drawled Lance Darby.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Purt&#8217;s day is spoiled,&#8221; declared Lance. &#8220;He
has come off without his cigarettes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cigarettes!&#8221; exclaimed Jess. &#8220;I thought
we had shown him the folly of smoking coffin
nails long ago.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he doesn&#8217;t smoke any,&#8221; Lance returned.
&#8220;But he always carries a case of them around
with him. You know, he bought a thousand once
with his monogram printed in gold on them, and
he never <i>will</i> get rid of them all. He thought it
would be a good thing to bring them to camp
with him so as to use them for a smudge to chase
off the mosquitoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they work all right,&#8221; grunted Chet.
&#8220;The smoke chases the mosquitoes, you can believe.
But then, the smoke chases <i>us</i>, too. Purt&#8217;s
brand of cigarettes is made out of long-filler Connecticut
cabbage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right; don&#8217;t make fun of the poor
fellow,&#8221; Lance said, with exaggerated sympathy.
&#8220;Even if anybody had cigarettes to lend him, he
couldn&#8217;t smoke any with anothah fellah&#8217;s monogram
on &#8217;em, don&#8217;tcher know, old top?&#8221;</p>
<p>But it came out that there was something else
on Purt Sweet&#8217;s mind. He had a very expensive
rod, reel, and book of flies. And to tell the truth,
he had never strung a line on such a rod, and did
not know any more about using the flies than a
baby in arms!</p>
<p>He hated to admit his ignorance, for the boys
were not at all tender with the Central High dude.
However, Chet and Lance were not ill-natured,
and Purt plucked up courage finally to beg Lance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
to take him privately up stream (when they
reached the creek) and give him a lesson in fly-casting.</p>
<p>Lance had already taken Laura under his wing&mdash;as
was to be expected; but Mother Wit made
him give Purt the assistance he needed. The
three wandered up stream, far above the series
of quiet pools where the other members of the
party were casting for trout, or fishing for perch.</p>
<p>The trio passed a series of rapids, several rods
long, and then struck a very beautiful stretch of
calm water, with tree-shaded banks, and shallows
where the cat-tails and rushes grew in thick clusters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a sign up yonder,&#8221; Laura said to Lance.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say a part of this stream was a private
fishing preserve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve been told. We won&#8217;t go beyond the
sign,&#8221; said Lance.</p>
<p>He got Laura and Purt properly stationed and
then cast, himself. They were having good sport
and had landed several beauties, when Billy Long
came idly up the stream on the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;Everywhere I go,
there are girls. Isn&#8217;t there a place where a fellow
can get away from them and fish? They chatter
so much that they drive all the fish into the mud,
with their fins over their ears&mdash;that&#8217;s right!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Horrid thing!&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;We can keep
just as silent when we&#8217;re fishing as any of you
boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it, then,&#8221; advised Short and Long, gruffly.</p>
<p>He kept on up stream. &#8220;Look out there,
Billy,&#8221; Lance advised. &#8220;It&#8217;s posted above there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Posted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Don&#8217;t you see that sign?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said the smaller boy. &#8220;I never <i>did</i>
believe in signs. And besides, it says there&#8217;s no
fishing here&mdash;and I believe it! I haven&#8217;t had a
bite all the way up this brook.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on a bit farther and cast his fly again.
Quiet fell upon the long pool, where the shadow
and sunshine lay in alternate blocks.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a scrambling through the
brush on the side of the stream where Short and
Long was standing, and then appeared a big dog
and a big man, the latter holding the former in
leash. The man was just as ugly looking as the
dog&mdash;and the Barnacle was a howling beauty beside
this dog!</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you!&#8221; exclaimed the man to Short and
Long&mdash;and he certainly <i>did</i> speak savagely.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIX_THE_YOUNG_MAN_WITH_THE_GUN' id='CHAPTER_XIX_THE_YOUNG_MAN_WITH_THE_GUN'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE GUN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, Lance!&#8221; gasped Laura Belding, in
a whisper. &#8220;I am afraid Short and Long will get
into trouble. That man looks perfectly savage!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the small boy did not seem to be in the
least disturbed. He had just made a very
pretty cast into the stream as the dog and its master
appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! can&#8217;t you read that there sign?&#8221; demanded
the man, very red in the face. The sign
really was plainly to be seen, and easily read. In
large black letters it said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>PRIVATE<br />
NO FISHING ALLOWED<br /></p>
<p>The angler looked at the sign on the tree unabashed
and observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t notice it. You see, Mister, they
taught me never to read anything marked
&#8216;Private.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it says &#8216;No fishin&#8217; allowed,&#8217; anyway,&#8221;
snarled the farmer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not fishing aloud,&#8221; came from Short
and Long, who was perfectly serious. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what I&#8217;ve been kickin&#8217; about. The other folks
down stream are making so much noise that
they&#8217;d give every trout in the brook nervous
prostration. I tell you I came up here especially
to be quiet about my fishing&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may think you&#8217;re funny, youngster,&#8221; interrupted
the man; &#8220;but you&#8217;re fishin&#8217; just the
same, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so&#8217;s you&#8217;d notice it,&#8221; declared Short and
Long. &#8220;All I&#8217;ve managed to do so far is to give
my fly a chance to swim. Haven&#8217;t even had a
rise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give yer a rise, confound ye!&#8221; roared the
man, coming with a rush through the bushes.
&#8220;Git out o&#8217; there, an&#8217; git out quick, or I&#8217;ll set
this dawg on ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Lance took a hand in the affair. He
shouted across the stream:</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a care, there, Mister! If that dog is
savage, don&#8217;t you turn him loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the dickens are <i>you</i>?&#8221; snarled the
farmer. &#8220;This is my land, and it&#8217;s posted, and
this here is my dawg&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me have that pistol of yours, Purt,&#8221; commanded
Lance, firmly, reeling in his line.</p>
<p>The dude, who had stood open-mouthed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
shaking, could not follow Lance&#8217;s lead worth a
cent. &#8220;You&mdash;you know, Lance,&#8221; he stammered,
&#8220;the pistol won&#8217;t shoot&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; cried the farmer, who had stopped
abruptly when Lance had spoken. &#8220;Tryin&#8217; to
scare me, was you? Now you step lively, or I&#8217;ll
let the dawg go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor sport!&#8221; gasped Lance, scowling at
the shaking dude.</p>
<p>Short and Long, having tempted the fates far
enough, was winding up his own line. And just
before the fly left the surface of the water a trout
jumped for it and caught the hook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whee!&#8221; yelled Short and Long, as the line
reeled out, singing shrilly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop that!&#8221; yelled the man. &#8220;That&#8217;s my
fish&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; responded the boy from Central
High. &#8220;I was reeling in, wasn&#8217;t I? He came
right up and jumped for my fly. Call off your
old fish, if you don&#8217;t want him caught on my hook
and line.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Billy Long was too saucy that time. He
was playing the fish while he talked, just as well
as he knew how. The farmer gave a yell, let the
dog&#8217;s strap run through his hand, and the beast,
with an angry bay, dashed straight at the youthful
fisherman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>Perhaps the farmer did not really intend doing
such a cruel thing. For the dog would have torn
Billy Long to pieces had he reached him.</p>
<p>There was a shout from across the stream&mdash;on
the side where Laura stood&mdash;and a man leaped
into the open. He carried a gun. As he reached
the bank of the brook he threw up the shot-gun
and erupted the contents of one barrel into the
fore-shoulder of the angry dog.</p>
<p>The distance was scarcely two rods. The small
shot peppered the dog well, and gave him a whole
lot to think of beside grabbing a defenseless boy.</p>
<p>The farmer began to yell vociferously; the dog
raised his voice even more loudly and, after falling
and rolling over and over on the ground for
a moment, he got to his feet and cut into the
bushes like a flash. He was more scared than
hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have you arrested for that!&#8221; yelled the
dog&#8217;s owner, shaking both clenched fists at the
young man with the gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better thank me that the beast did not
grab that boy,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>The young man with the gun seemed perfectly
calm. He was a pale-faced young man, well
dressed in a hunting suit, and with narrow boots
on his rather small feet. He was doubtless a city
sportsman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I bet I know who you be, ye scoundrel!&#8221;
bawled the farmer.</p>
<p>The young man turned away instantly. Laura
saw that he flushed and then paled again. He
did not stop to say a word to the party of young
folk from Centerport. Instead, he stepped into
the thick underbrush and was almost instantly
lost to their sight.</p>
<p>Short and Long had hastened to get over the
border of the farmer&#8217;s posted preserve. But he
had brought the trout with him&mdash;and it weighed
a good pound and a half!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>LAURA KEEPS HER SECRET</h3>
</div>
<p>They left the farmer threatening vengeance
upon the strange young man who had used his
shot-gun to such good purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow&#8217;s all right, whoever he is,&#8221; Lance
declared. &#8220;And how quick he was with his
gun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows how to use one,&#8221; Short and Long
agreed, with admiration. &#8220;I wish I could have
thanked him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this dummy here!&#8221; added Lance, with a
look of disgust at Purt. &#8220;You had that old pistol
in your pocket, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he demanded of the
dude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; agreed Purt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if you had kept still about it, I could
have scared that farmer into holding his dog in
leash. Just as glad the brute was shot, though.
He&#8217;ll be tamed for a while, I bet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad the dog was trained so badly,&#8221;
Laura said. &#8220;It is not his fault that he was
taught to attack people.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; grunted Short and Long. &#8220;If he&#8217;d
grabbed me, I reckon he&#8217;d have eaten me up before
anybody could have helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had no business on that man&#8217;s land,&#8221;
said Laura, admonishingly. &#8220;And you <i>did</i> sauce
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh! who&#8217;d have thought he was so mean?&#8221;
growled Short and Long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet you have a care next time,&#8221; said Lance,
grinning. &#8220;But who do you suppose that fellow
with the gun was? I&#8217;d really like to meet him
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good sort, whoever he is,&#8221; Short and Long
agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No farmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much! He was city-dressed all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura listened to their comments, but said nothing.
She believed she could make a good guess
as to who the young man was; but she was keeping
that secret to herself.</p>
<p>When she and the three boys rejoined their
companions down stream, they had enough to tell
about the adventure without declaring the identity
of the young man with the gun. It was exciting
enough to have had Short and Long almost
&#8220;chawed up&#8221; by a savage dog, as Lance
expressed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this useless piece of goods,&#8221; he added
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
taking Purt by the collar, &#8220;made a foozle&mdash;right
off the reel! I could have scared that big bully
easily enough if Purt had kept still about his old
revolver being no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; complained Purt. &#8220;The revolver
would have been all right if you hadn&#8217;t
taken that screw out and thrown it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;d likely shot yourself&mdash;or somebody
else&mdash;by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Purt, gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Chet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I find that when I bought cartridges
for that pistol I got thirty-eights&mdash;and the pistol
is a forty-five!&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole crowd laughed at that. Purt Sweet
really <i>was</i> too funny for anything.</p>
<p>They got another good laugh on him before
they went back to the island. There was a squatter&#8217;s
cabin near the bank of the brook and they
trooped up there for a drink of cool milk, for the
woman had two cows and was willing to sell the
milk to them, right from her log buttery.</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s daughter&mdash;a girl about Lil Pendleton&#8217;s
age&mdash;waited on them. She was a brown-skinned,
big-eyed, healthy-looking girl&mdash;a regular
country beauty. Laura whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she a splendid creature?&#8221;</p>
<p>Purt had cocked an appreciative eye at her, and
he murmured:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Quite true&mdash;quite true, Miss Laura. She&#8217;s
as beautiful as Hebe,&#8221; and gave the name of the
goddess the very best pronunciation, according
to Professor Dimp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautiful as <i>he</i> be?&#8221; drawled Chet, in exaggeration
of bucolic twang, looking amusedly
at the lank and lazy squatter himself who lay
snoring on the platform before the hut. &#8220;Huh!
she&#8217;s a sight purtier than <i>he</i> be. Why, <i>he&#8217;s</i> as
humbly as a hedge-fence&mdash;an&#8217; ye can see, Purt,
that the girl takes after her mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is too bad how they rig you, Pretty,&#8221;
laughed Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty&#8217;s all right!&#8221; joined in Billy Long.
&#8220;Only one thing wrong with him. He starts
easy, and he speeds up well, but just at the critical
moment he always skids.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear the motor talk from Short and Long!
Yow!&#8221; exclaimed Reddy Butts. &#8220;And old
Purt&#8217;s not so slow at that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who said he was slow?&#8221; demanded Short
and Long, with apparent indignation. &#8220;Bet you
can&#8217;t do him, Reddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet I can&mdash;and for half a dollar, too,&#8221; declared
the youth with the radiant head of hair.</p>
<p>This was after the party had returned to the
creek and luncheon was in order. The other boys
saw that the red-headed youth and Short and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Long had a scheme between them, and they sat
back and prepared to enjoy Purt&#8217;s discomfiture.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t fool Purt in a hundred years,&#8221;
Short and Long reiterated, quite hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can,&#8221; returned Reddy, briefly, with his mouth
full. &#8220;Got a half dollar, Purt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I have?&#8221; demanded the dude, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You put it under that mug on the table, and I
bet I can take the money without touching the
mug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cawn&#8217;t trick me,&#8221; drawled Port. &#8220;You
couldn&#8217;t do that, you know, Reddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your half dollar under the mug and see
if I can&#8217;t,&#8221; chuckled the auburn-haired youth.</p>
<p>Thus urged, Purt did as agreed. He placed a
half dollar on the table, and carefully covered it
with an inverted mug that he had been drinking
milk from.</p>
<p>Everybody was interested now and was watching
the proceedings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better put a napkin over it, Purt,&#8221; advised
Reddy. &#8220;For I&#8217;m going to fool you a whole
lot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cawn&#8217;t fool me, deah boy!&#8221; declared the
dude, with growing conviction.</p>
<p>But he carefully covered the mug. Then
Reddy, with a grin, reached under the rough table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
they were using and soon pulled his hand back
with a half dollar in the palm.</p>
<p>The boys laughed, and wondered, and the girls
were likewise puzzled. Purt looked both amazed
and vexed. Then they began to laugh at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty easy way to make half a dollar,&#8221; commented
Reddy, slipping it into his pocket. &#8220;I
told you I&#8217;d get it, Purt, without touching the
mug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t do it, doncher know!&#8221; cried
Purt, growing exasperated. &#8220;My half dollar is
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He whipped off the napkin, lifted the mug&mdash;and
Reddy, with a laugh, grabbed the coin that lay
under it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I&#8217;d get it without lifting the
mug, Purt,&#8221; he said, and the crowd burst into a
chorus of laughter. Purt had been made the victim
of the joke, after all.</p>
<p>It was all good fun, however. Purt could well
afford the half dollar, and after a minute he, too,
laughed.</p>
<p>They started back for Acorn Island in good
season, with a nice string of speckled trout and
some two dozen white perch&mdash;the promise of a
splendid &#8220;fish-fry&#8221; that evening. On the way
they passed the heavy canoe seen several times
before on the lake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>There was but one man in it now, fishing; and
he sat with his shoulders hunched up and his hat
drawn down about his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder who that old man is?&#8221; Chet said,
reflectively, as the <i>Bonnie Lass</i> sped by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder where his camp is?&#8221; responded
Lance, idly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks like a native,&#8221; Reddy said. &#8220;If
he&#8217;s no handsomer than that squatter back yonder,
I wouldn&#8217;t want to see him any closer to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura, and Jess, and Bobby looked at each other
surreptitiously. They knew that the man in the
canoe was Professor Asa Dimp, Latin teacher at
Central High!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE SHERIFF WITH HIS DOGS</h3>
</div>
<p>Another evening melted into night, leaving in
the minds of most of the girls of Central High
now encamped on Acorn Island, a feeling of contentment
and pleasure because of a well-spent
day.</p>
<p>Their activities had been joyous ones; their fun
and sport healthful; and nothing had really occurred
to trouble their minds.</p>
<p>Of course, Laura was an exception to the
others. Jess and Bobby were to a degree
disturbed over the mystery of the young man who
had visited the camp on two occasions, and about
their unexpected discovery of Professor Dimp&#8217;s
presence on Acorn Island.</p>
<p>But it was Mother Wit who had thought out
the true significance of these mysterious happenings.
She had reason to believe that the &#8220;Mr.
Norman&#8221; whom Lizzie Bean had talked about&mdash;and
the man who had frightened the same Lizzie
and robbed the camp of food&mdash;and the Norman
Halliday who was wanted by the sheriff for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
robbery of the Merchants and Miners Bank of
Albany, was one and the same person.</p>
<p>Not alone that, but he was camping on this
island, without a permit from the Rocky River
Lumber Company; and his companion was their
own respected, if not well-liked, Professor Dimp.</p>
<p>Certainly the old professor could have had
nothing to do with the robbery of the bank; nor
could he have reaped any benefit by such crime.
Laura was sure that the old professor was perfectly
honest and respectable.</p>
<p>He was surely not camping against his will,
with the strange young man who had saved Short
and Long from the farmer&#8217;s savage dog. Professor
Dimp must have some deep interest in him.</p>
<p>Laura, too, could not believe the young man
with the gun to be a criminal of the character the
newspapers had given the thief and forger who
had betrayed his employers in the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;That young man has a good face. If Lizzie&#8217;s
story is true, too, he has a good heart. And he
was quick to act to-day when he saved Billy Long;
he took a chance for a stranger, when it was unwise
for him to show himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a mystery about him. The professor
would not be with the young man if he were
bad&mdash;oh! I am sure of that,&#8221; concluded Laura.</p>
<p>This discussion Laura carried on in her mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
She did not take even Jess into her inmost confidence,
and Chet&mdash;of course&mdash;went back to the
mainland with the rest of the boys, when bedtime
came.</p>
<p>Poor old Professor Dimp! He had ever been
the butt for his careless pupils&#8217; pranks. His eccentricities,
his absent-mindedness, and his devotion
to what Bobby called &#8220;the dead parts of
speech&#8221; had made him an object of the pupils&#8217;
dislike and a subject for their wit.</p>
<p>Of course, they knew he was wonderfully well
educated&mdash;that the depths of Latin and Greek
were easily plumbed by his thought. But respect
for a teacher&#8217;s attainments does not always breed
love for the teacher&mdash;nor an appreciation of the
said teacher&#8217;s softer qualities, either.</p>
<p>Laura had come to the conclusion that there
must be a side to &#8220;Old Dimple&#8217;s&#8221; character that
few of his pupils had surmised.</p>
<p>There was a bond between Professor Dimp
and that mysterious young man from Albany
that Laura Belding did not understand. Yet she
sought her cot that night with a belief that the
old gentleman was good and kind, and that the
accusation against his young companion must be
very, very wrong!</p>
<p>Could she have climbed a tree like Short and
Long, Laura would have gone to the top of one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
of the big oaks near the camp, the next morning
at daybreak. From that height she knew she
could see most of the open patches on the island,
clear to the western end.</p>
<p>She was very curious as to whether Professor
Dimp was still camping in the little glade where
she and her comrades had met him. And had the
young man returned from the north side of the
lake where she had seen him the day before?</p>
<p>Laura was an early riser, as ever, that morning.
She was tempted, before the camp was generally
astir, to run out to the end of the island and see
if the Professor&#8217;s camp were still established
there.</p>
<p>But Professor Dimp had been so sharp with her
and the other girls, that Laura half feared to
meet him. He was certainly a stern old gentleman,
and she remembered now that, from the
time the girls of Central High had decided to
come here to Acorn Island to camp, Professor
Dimp had been quite put out about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; thought Laura, &#8220;he was planning to
come here himself at that time. He must have
already arranged to meet the young man here.
And he considers us interlopers. It&#8217;s very, very
strange!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor did Laura wish to discuss the affair with
Jess or Bobby Hargrew. She was afraid to tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
anybody what she surmised about Professor
Dimp&#8217;s companion.</p>
<p>It was after breakfast&mdash;which Liz served with
all the spirit and cheerfulness, so Bobby said, of
an Egyptian mummy with the mumps!&mdash;that they
first spied the big barge coming from the north
shore of the lake.</p>
<p>The slow-moving craft was under sail and
there were several men aboard of her, as well as a
pack of dogs which now and then gave tongue.
Immediately the Barnacle went raving mad. The
sigh and sound of so many canines heading toward
the island that had been his own domain
for a week, quite drove the Barnacle out of such
few senses as he possessed.</p>
<p>He barked at the barge from the heights where
the camp stood; then he raced down to the shore
and emitted a salvo of barks from the landing on
that side of the island. Then he raced back again,
and so returned to the shore&mdash;alternating in his
rushes in the craziest possible way.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the barge drew nearer and nearer.
The general question at the girls&#8217; camp was:
&#8220;Why were the men and dogs coming to Acorn
Island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t land here without a permit,&#8221;
Bobby declared. &#8220;The Rocky River Lumber
Company has posted the island.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what sort of game can they hunt with
hounds this time of year?&#8221; demanded Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are bloodhounds,&#8221; said her mother,
calmly. &#8220;English bloodhounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; squealed Bobby, suddenly.
&#8220;Bloodhounds? Don&#8217;t you all feel just like Eliza
crossing the ice, girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; cried Dora, laughing. &#8220;On a
hot day like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>The cicadas were filing their saws in the tops
of the trees and the promise of one of the hottest
days of the season danced in the shimmer of haze
over the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really suppose they are coming here
with those dogs?&#8221; repeated Nell.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have no business to land,&#8221; said Bobby,
again serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know who they are!&#8221; Jess cried, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chet said something about a sheriff coming
to the boys&#8217; camp over yonder. And he had a
pack of bloodhounds with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should an officer of the law come
<i>here</i>?&#8221; queried Mrs. Morse.</p>
<p>Laura, and Jess, and Bobby looked at each
other. Of course, Mother Wit had understood
the approach of the barge from the first; but she
had said nothing. Now Jess and Bobby burst out
with:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! he must be after that young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What young man?&#8221; was the chorus of the
other campers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young man who is with Professor
Dimp,&#8221; said the thoughtless Bobby. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that
it, Laura?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura groaned. The cat was out of the bag
now, and she foresaw much trouble in the camp
on Acorn Island.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>WHERE PROFESSOR DIMP COMES IN BIG</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;What under the sun are you talking about,
Bobby?&#8221; demanded Lil Pendleton; and Nell
cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Dimp! What do you know about
the professor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is <i>he</i> here?&#8221; demanded Dora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Old Dimple?&#8221; chimed in her twin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You surprise me, Clara,&#8221; said Mrs. Morse.
&#8220;Are you referring to your Latin teacher? and is
he anywhere near here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, gracious! I&#8217;m always putting my foot
into it whenever I open my mouth,&#8221; groaned
Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;A highly impossible athletic feat, I am sure,
Bobby,&#8221; said Jess, unable to keep from laughing,
although she knew Bobby deserved chiding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know what this means,&#8221; exclaimed
Lil again. &#8220;Who is this sheriff after? And why
is Old Dimple mixed up in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the fellow who came and robbed our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
larder!&#8221; shrieked Nell, guessing the enigma at
last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that is who the sheriff is looking
for,&#8221; admitted Laura, gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why <i>here</i>?&#8221; cried Lil. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t that
fellow take the food and get away from the
island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not find him&mdash;that&#8217;s sure!&#8221; said Dora
Lockwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barnacle found his camp, and we saw Professor
Dimp there,&#8221; explained Laura seeing that
a clean breast of it was the better way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s &#8216;we?&#8217;&#8221; demanded Lil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jess and Bobby and I. We spoke to the old
professor, and he was real cross to us. He would
not tell us anything about the young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Liz <i>did</i> see that Mr. Norman the night
we were robbed?&#8221; said Nell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I expect so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Norman?&#8217;&#8221; Nell repeated, reflectively.
&#8220;And the fellow who robbed that bank in Albany
is Norman Halliday? The very same!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you knew this all along, Laura Belding?&#8221;
cried Lil. &#8220;You mean thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, quit, Lil,&#8221; advised Bobby, gruffly.
&#8220;Why should Laura stir up a row and scare you
all? I never till this very moment guessed who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
the fellow might be, myself. Of course the sheriff
is looking for him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And on this island!&#8221; murmured Lil. &#8220;A
criminal!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how much of a criminal he
is,&#8221; said Laura, stoutly. &#8220;He was the fellow that
saved Short and Long from that dog yesterday,
I verily believe,&#8221; and she wagged her head. &#8220;<i>He</i>
didn&#8217;t look very desperate, I can tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness! that&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Bobby, eagerly.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s keep the sheriff off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to do it?&#8221; asked Jess.
&#8220;Go down there and stone him when the barge
comes near?&#8221; and she chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t any permit. This is private
land&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t he search the island for a lawbreaker?&#8221;
asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that he has a right to, without a
warrant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we try to stop him,&#8221; said Laura, slowly,
&#8220;won&#8217;t he suspect that we don&#8217;t want him to
search the island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; exclaimed Lil, angrily. &#8220;What do <i>we</i>
care?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want him to find that poor fellow,&#8221;
said Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; repeated Lil, sharply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After he saved Short and Long&#8217;s life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! should we pass a vote of thanks to
him for <i>that</i>?&#8221; demanded Lil, with, sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for that, perhaps,&#8221; Laura said, gently.
&#8220;But think of the old professor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Dimple!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old Prof?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The chorus rose loud and general. Laura
flushed, but held her ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our loyalty to Central High ought to be
enough to prompt us to help one of our teachers.
In some way the old professor is connected with
this young man who is in danger of arrest. I
don&#8217;t mean that we should actually thwart the
officer of the law. But I, for one, certainly will
not help the officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Mother Wit!&#8221; cried Bobby.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go a step farther. I&#8217;ll try to keep that man
from landing here with his dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing about the right or wrong of
the case,&#8221; said Mrs. Morse; &#8220;but I am afraid of
those awful beasts. There are five of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Barnacle will only get into a fight with
them if they land,&#8221; declared Jess, rather amused.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go down to the lake in a body and refuse
to allow the dogs to come ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz Bean had listened from the cook-tent, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
said nothing. Her plain face was as expressionless
as ever.</p>
<p>Now, when Mrs. Morse and the girls of Central
High started down the slope on the northern side
of the knoll, Liz slipped into the woods to the
west, and quickly disappeared in the thick underbrush.</p>
<p>The big mainsail of the barge had been dropped
and the men with the sheriff were paddling the
craft in to the shore. Now and then a hound
would lift its head and utter a mournful bay.
Then Barnacle would strive to bark his own head
off!</p>
<p>Laura recognized one of the paddlers with a
start of surprise. It was the vicious farmer who
had set his dog on Short and Long, on Bang-up
Creek!</p>
<p>If she had had any doubts about the right and
wrong of an attempt to thwart the sheriff before,
Laura had none <i>now</i>. Perhaps her course was
indefensible; but intuitively she believed that
farmer to be a bad man. And she was sure that
he was the one who had set the sheriff on this
trail.</p>
<p>He had doubtless followed the young man with
the gun and seen him join Professor Dimp. The
two had paddled for Acorn Island. The farmer
had communicated with the sheriff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>Right then, so hotly burned Laura&#8217;s righteous
indignation, that she would have done her very
best to keep the officer of the law from landing
those bloodhounds, and chasing the mysterious
&#8220;Mr. Norman&#8221; out of his hiding place.</p>
<p>But it was Bobby who put the ball into play
first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mister! don&#8217;t you bring those dogs
ashore here!&#8221; she called to the sheriff.</p>
<p>He was a big, red-faced, beefy-looking man,
with a bristling mustache and little, piglike eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanter know!&#8221; he said, huskily. &#8220;Who do
you think you are giving orders to, young lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a sheriff, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes I be,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are searching all the woods around
about for a convict?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not perzactly. But he&#8217;s likely ter be a convic&#8217;
arter I git him,&#8221; and he chuckled, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this island is posted. We have a permit
to camp here, but I don&#8217;t believe <i>you</i> have any
warrant for landing at all,&#8221; said Bobby, sharply.
&#8220;And my father, who is one of the directors of
the Rocky River Lumber Company, certainly
does not want a pack of hounds like those, running
the game on this island&mdash;out of season,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t that kind o&#8217; game, young lady,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
said the sheriff, slowly. Then he stopped. A
figure had suddenly appeared from the wood. It
was a shabby but commanding figure, and the
girls themselves shrank together and waited for
the old Latin professor to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Hargrew is quite right,&#8221; said Professor
Dimp, in his iciest tone. &#8220;Those hounds must not
land here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, now!&#8221; growled the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is private property,&#8221; continued Professor
Dimp, coldly, &#8220;as Miss Hargrew tells you.
You can see the signs. You will trespass here if
you are determined. But I warn you that if you
bring those dogs ashore you will be prosecuted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to search this islan&#8217;,&#8221; growled
Sheriff Larkin, uglily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may. You have no warrant to do so, but
you may. But you must not bring ashore those
dogs. And,&#8221; added the professor, turning and
bowing with old-fashioned courtesy to Mrs.
Morse, &#8220;you must keep away from the camp
where this lady and her young charges are ensconced.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on his heel in conclusion, and walked
into the woods again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three rousing cheers!&#8221; whispered Bobby under
her breath. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Old
Dimple? <i>He&#8217;s</i> all right!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>LIZ ON THE DEFENSIVE</h3>
</div>
<p>The professor had spoken with such authority
that Sheriff Larkin hesitated in his intention of
landing the bloodhounds. Besides, having learned
that one of these girls was a daughter of a member
of the powerful lumber company, he feared
to make a misstep.</p>
<p>The Rocky River Lumber Company could
make or break a sheriff easily enough. The
political power of the men owning the corporation
in Monadnock County was supreme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I tell ye what it is, ladies,&#8221; he said,
pulling off his broad brimmed hat to wipe a perspiring,
red brow. &#8220;I gotter do my duty&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the prospect of five hundred dollars
ahead of you!&#8221; interposed Bobby, pertly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t neither here nor there,&#8221; declared
the man. &#8220;I got to search the island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know best what you must do, sir,&#8221; said
Mrs. Morse, coldly. &#8220;But I beg of you to leave
your dogs on the boat. I am afraid of the
brutes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t come to <i>our</i> camp, I pray, looking
for any criminal,&#8221; said Laura, speaking for the
first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! I guess not, Ma&#8217;am!&#8221; cried the sheriff.
&#8220;Come on, boys. Leave them dawgs tied yere.
And we&#8217;ll go over the island. It&#8217;s purty open
timber this end, so he ain&#8217;t likely to be near here.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had moored the barge. Barnacle had
barked himself hoarse. When the sheriff and
four of his companions leaped ashore, he put his
tail between his legs and scuttled up the hillside
again.</p>
<p>At the top he suddenly began to bark once
more. He did not face down hill, but seemed distraught
about something, or somebody, in the
camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; exclaimed the ugly farmer whom
Laura had taken a dislike to the previous day.
&#8220;That dawg sees something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is crazy,&#8221; spoke up Laura, quickly. &#8220;He
is like enough barking at our maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; rejoined Bobby. &#8220;Liz is up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; exclaimed the sheriff to his men,
and started westward, in the direction Professor
Dimp had taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you suppose the Barnacle is really
barking at?&#8221; whispered Jess to Laura Belding.
&#8220;He&#8217;d never make all that &#8216;catouse&#8217; over Liz.
In fact, he wouldn&#8217;t bark at her at all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; warned Laura, as the party started
up the slope toward the camp.</p>
<p>Jess looked at her curiously. Barnacle was still
barking with desperate determination. Liz appeared
before the Central High girls climbed to
the top of the hillock, and catching the dog by the
collar, dragged him over to the corner of the log
cabin and snapped on his chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Laura heard her say. &#8220;Ye kin bark
your head off&mdash;but ye can&#8217;t run.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl went back to her cook-tent and began
clearing up the breakfast things again. Laura
noted that she seemed to have done nothing while
they were down on the shore.</p>
<p>But that was not surprising; perhaps she had
crept near to overhear the talk with the sheriff.
Now Liz said nothing to any of them, and went
grimly on with her work.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my turn to help you get dinner, Lizzie,&#8221;
Laura said, quietly. &#8220;What are we going to
have? Shall I begin by peeling the potatoes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Don&#8217;t want yer,&#8221; said Liz, shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! of course you want some help&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t neither!&#8221; snapped the maid-of-all-work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lizzie!&#8221; said Laura, in surprise&mdash;at
least, in apparent surprise! &#8220;You surely don&#8217;t
want to do all the work yourself?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d ruther,&#8221; responded the girl, ungraciously.
&#8220;You gals are in my way in the tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now this, of course, was ridiculous. It could
mean but one thing: Liz was anxious to be alone
in the cook-tent. And <i>why</i>?</p>
<p>Laura, however, merely said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! very well. If you prefer not to be
helped, Lizzie, that is all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she walked away; but she did not lose
sight of the cook-tent. There was somebody
there beside the maid-of-all-work, and Laura was
sure she knew <i>who</i>.</p>
<p>Lil was inclined to feel abused. She thought
that she should have been taken into the secret at
the first.</p>
<p>&#8220;But see how you would have kicked,&#8221; said
the slangy Bobby. &#8220;Why! you&#8217;d have wanted
to go back home by the first boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we ought to have stayed here
with that man on the island,&#8221; grumbled Lil.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the old professor tagging after him?&#8221;
chuckled Jess. &#8220;My goodness! can there be anything
more respectable than Old Dimple?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he is, why is he mixed up with this bank
thief?&#8221; asked Lil, bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the young man is any such
thing,&#8221; announced Laura, hearing this. &#8220;He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
doesn&#8217;t look bad. And surely we can trust to the
professor&#8217;s judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we ought to help Professor Dimp,&#8221; said
Nell. &#8220;Poor old man! I am sorry for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! Old Dimple&#8217;s a good sort,&#8221; declared
Bobby, enthusiastically. &#8220;And he certainly stood
up to that red-faced sheriff this morning&mdash;Oh,
gee!&#8221; finished the tomboy, with a gasp. &#8220;Here
he is now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s who?&#8221; squealed Lil, whirling around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Dimp?&#8221; demanded Nell.</p>
<p>But it was the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, young ladies,&#8221; he wheezed. &#8220;But
I feel it my duty to s&#8217;arch this yere camp. If
you ain&#8217;t a-hidin&#8217; of that thar feller, ye won&#8217;t
mind my pokin&#8217; around a bit, will yer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura did not say a word. She stood up and
looked over at Liz Bean. For a moment the maid-of-all-work
seemed petrified.</p>
<p>Then she dove for the growling Barnacle. She
untied the rope with which he was fastened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed the puffing sheriff.
&#8220;What&#8217;s <i>that</i> for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz held the Barnacle with difficulty; the dog
bared his teeth at the sheriff and uttered a series
of most blood-curdling growls.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come botherin&#8217; around <i>here</i>,&#8221; said Liz,
desperately, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll let him fly at ye!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE BARNACLE TREES SOMETHING AT LAST</h3>
</div>
<p>Both the girls of Central High, and their
brothers and boy friends, in the camp across the
lake, had believed the Barnacle to be &#8220;all bluff.&#8221;
He was a fine dog for barking, as Short and Long
had said, but he acted as though he thought his
teeth had been given him for chewing his food,
and for nothing else.</p>
<p>The savage way in which he bayed the sheriff,
however, and tried to get at him as Liz held him
in leash, was really surprising. It was no wonder
that Sheriff Larkin started back and cried out
in alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare set that dawg on me, young
woman!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have the law on yer, if
yer do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll chaw yer up if I let him go,&#8221; threatened
Liz. &#8220;Git out o&#8217; here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lizzie!&#8221; gasped Mrs. Morse, coming
to the door of the cabin, and speaking to the girl
in a most amazed tone. &#8220;What does this
mean?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a body snatcher! he&#8217;s a man hunter! he&#8217;s
ev&#8217;rything mean an&#8217; filthy!&#8221; exclaimed the girl,
her face red and her eyes blazing. Her appearance
was really most astonishing. Laura would
never have believed that &#8220;Lonesome Liz&#8221; could
display so much emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him bother this camp if he dares!&#8221; went
on Liz. &#8220;He was told by that old gentleman to
keep away from here, wasn&#8217;t he? Then let him
run, for I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to hold this dawg in much
longer!&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed that her threat would hold true. At
every leap Barnacle made, he seemed about to tear
the rope from her grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Missis!&#8221; yelled the sheriff to Mrs. Morse.
&#8220;You&#8217;d better call that gal off&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; to do with it,&#8221; declared
Liz. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t workin&#8217; for her no more. I ain&#8217;t
workin&#8217; for nobody. I&#8217;ve struck, I have! You
can&#8217;t hold nobody responserble but me an&#8217; Barnacle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The gal&#8217;s crazy!&#8221; squalled the sheriff, going
rapidly backward, for the dog and Liz were advancing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t shet me up in no &#8217;sylum,&#8221; declared
Liz, grimly. &#8220;But ye <i>may</i> send me ter the
penitentiary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear the like?&#8221; gasped Lil,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
clinging to Nellie and Jess. &#8220;That girl&#8217;s mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is brave,&#8221; muttered Jess. &#8220;But&mdash;but I
wonder what she&#8217;s up to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura did not question the maid-of-all-work.
She thought she already knew. There was
method in Lizzie&#8217;s madness, that was sure!</p>
<p>She was driving the bullying sheriff away from
the cook-tent&mdash;away from the camp, indeed. He
was going sideways like a crab, and Barnacle was
growling and almost choking himself as he tugged
at his collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out! Scat!&#8221; exclaimed Liz. &#8220;I&#8217;m
a-goin&#8217; to let this dawg <i>go</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;cher dare!&#8221; shouted Sheriff Larkin.</p>
<p>But the girl deliberately stooped over Barnacle,
and began to unfasten the rope. At that the officer
of the law turned and lumbered down the hill.</p>
<p>Where his companions were the girls did not
know. And the barge with the bloodhounds had
been poled off shore a few rods. The keeper was
sitting on it and calmly smoking his pipe.</p>
<p>Sheriff Larkin was some rods from the shore.
With a sudden roar Barnacle slipped his leash
and tore down the slope. The dog had run a lot
of game on Acorn Island since being landed here;
but never a quarry like this.</p>
<p>The big man gave one glance behind and then
lost all hope of reaching the boat. There was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
low-branching tree before him: He leaped for
the nearest branch and swung his booted legs for
a moment while he tried to hitch up on the
limb.</p>
<p>The Barnacle jumped for him. The dog
fastened to his heel, and for the first time the
girls saw that the mongrel-cur really had a terrific
grip.</p>
<p>Sheriff Larkin scrambled up into the tree; but
for half a minute Barnacle swung from him, clear
of the ground. When he dropped to the ground
the heel of the sheriff&#8217;s boot came with the dog&#8217;s
jaws!</p>
<p>Barnacle crouched down and began to masticate
the heel. But the glare that he turned upward
at the man, from his red-rimmed eyes, proclaimed
the fact that he would &#8220;just as lives&#8221;
chew on the sheriff&#8217;s anatomy.</p>
<p>The camp on the top of the knoll had been left
in confusion. The girls were talking rather
wildly&mdash;some praising Liz and others deploring
the happening.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse commanded silence. She walked
over to where the maid-of-all-work stood before
the cook-tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean, Lizzie Bean?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I ain&#8217;t workin&#8217; for you no more,&#8221;
cried Liz, wildly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve give up me job.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you had no right to do what you have
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;d done more. I&#8217;d gone at that
sheriff with my finger-nails if he&#8217;d come nearer.
Don&#8217;t I hate him&mdash;<i>just</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, Lizzie!&#8221; gasped the gentle Mrs.
Morse.</p>
<p>Here Laura interfered. &#8220;I believe I know
what is the matter with Lizzie, Mrs. Morse,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; snapped Lil, in the background.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear it. The girl&#8217;s crazy. My mother
would never have paid for such a creature to
come here with us if she&#8217;d known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your ma needn&#8217;t give me a cent, Miss,&#8221; returned
Liz, sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter with her, Laura?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Morse again.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has somebody hidden in that tent,&#8221; said
Mother Wit, calmly. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the truth, Lizzie?
Isn&#8217;t Mr. Halliday in there&mdash;Mr. Norman
Halliday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bank robber!&#8221; shrieked Lil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; gasped Nellie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurray for Liz!&#8221; exclaimed Bobby, but in a
low tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It cannot be?&#8221; queried Mrs. Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes he is. I got him here while youse folks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
was down talkin&#8217; to that red-faced sheriff. He
was good to me when I lived at that boardin&#8217;
house, in Albany, he was! I wouldn&#8217;t give him
up to that sheriff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morse looked at Laura very gravely.
&#8220;<i>You</i> have known about this for some time,
Laura? You knew that the young man was on
the island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Professor Dimp&mdash;yes,&#8221; said Mother
Wit, bravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Dimp has his own actions to answer
for,&#8221; said Jess&#8217; mother, gravely. &#8220;But I am
quite sure your mother would not approve of your
trying to help such a character as this young man
seems to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Mrs. Morse,&#8221; cried Laura.
&#8220;Here come Chet and the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys!&#8221; chorused the other girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has your brother to do with this affair?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Morse, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Chet wig-wagging a little while ago,
and I answered and read his message. He is
bringing over a gentleman from Albany&mdash;a lawyer&mdash;to
see Professor Dimp and the young man
who has been in hiding so long. I think something
important is going to happen,&#8221; said Laura,
complacently. &#8220;Do let the Barnacle keep the
sheriff up in that tree for a little while longer.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;QUITE ALL RIGHT&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>One amazing thing was happening after another.
The girls of Central High could scarcely
keep up with the several happenings. On top of
Laura&#8217;s statement the platform before the cook-tent
heaved mightily, and a man&#8217;s head and shoulders
appeared.</p>
<p>Lil shrieked again. Even Mrs. Morse stepped
back in surprise. The young man continued to
push his way out, and finally climbed to his feet.</p>
<p>It was the same young man who had appeared
on the bank of Bang-up Creek and saved Short
and Long from the farmer&#8217;s dog. His very good
looking hunting suit was now sadly torn and
wrinkled. He was without a hat. There was a
scratch upon his face that had drawn blood, and
he was altogether rather messy looking.</p>
<p>He bowed gravely to Mrs. Morse. &#8220;I see,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;that this young lady,&#8221; and he looked at
Laura, &#8220;knows who I am. And further introduction
would be unnecessary.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&mdash;yes?&#8221; said Mrs. Morse, rather doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pray that you will not blame Lizzie Bean.
She would sacrifice herself for my safety; but I
could hardly allow her to do that, don&#8217;t you
know? I had an idea that that sheriff would
really not come to this camp, and I could get away
again after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lil had given over any intention of screaming
again. She was examining the scratched face of
the strange young man with growing approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he romantic looking?&#8221; she whispered
to Nellie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow,&#8221; sighed the doctor&#8217;s daughter.
&#8220;He <i>doesn&#8217;t</i> look wicked, does he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a regular heart-breaker when he&#8217;s dolled
up, I bet,&#8221; giggled Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; murmured the Lockwood
twins, in unison.</p>
<p>Thus did the appearance of the young man,
Mr. Norman Halliday, tell upon the covey of
frightened girls. Mrs. Morse herself began to
recover from her disturbance of mind. <i>This</i> was
no criminal character, for sure!</p>
<p>Suddenly the sheriff in the tree set up a bellow:
&#8220;That&#8217;s the feller I want! That&#8217;s him! Don&#8217;t
you let him escape&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come down and take him?&#8221;
demanded Bobby, wickedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>But immediately the Barnacle began leaping
under the tree and barking and Sheriff Larkin
climbed higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, the police want me,&#8221; explained the
young man, simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we should judge so,&#8221; gasped Mrs.
Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I really don&#8217;t want to be arrested. Especially
by this sheriff. I do not want the bank
I work for to be put to the expense of paying him
a reward for my apprehension.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sounded rather odd&mdash;from a criminal!</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; went on the young man, with a
more cheerful smile, &#8220;I am going to return to
Albany when my attorney lets me know that I
may safely do so. Had I remained when I was
first charged with the crime of forging names to
coupons and bonds, and selling the same for my
own benefit, I could not have disproved the accusation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It had been arranged to make me a &#8216;scapegoat&#8217;&mdash;to
railroad me to jail, in fact. But I
have one good friend, at least&mdash;my uncle, Professor
Dimp. You all doubtless know him, and
know what a really fine old fellow he is,&#8221; said
the young man, heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is paying my lawyer&#8217;s expenses, and he
insisted, too, upon coming up here into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
Big Woods and staying with me. That&#8217;s why I
was really obliged to rob your larder one night.
I dared not appear at any store to buy food, and
I could not let the dear old man go hungry. I
hope the money I left was sufficient to pay for the
food?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly&mdash;certainly,&#8221; murmured Mrs. Morse,
while the girls listened in wide-eyed amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Professor is just a brick,&#8221; continued Mr.
Norman Halliday, &#8220;as of course you all
know&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we do!&#8221; burst out Bobby, her face
aflame. &#8220;Three cheers for Old D&#8211;&#8211;That
is, for Professor Asa Dimp!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Hargrew,&#8221; said the dry
voice of the absent-minded old professor. &#8220;I
did not know I was so well appreciated by the
girls of Central High.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Laura showed <i>her</i> appreciation in an entirely
unlooked for way. As the professor
walked into the open from the woods, she darted
for him, seized him tightly in her arms, and
planted a kiss first on one, and then on his other
unshaven cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my soul! bless my soul!&#8221; gasped Professor
Dimp, who had probably not been kissed
before in years.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a perfect old <i>dear</i>!&#8221; declared Laura,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
in a low voice. &#8220;And I am never going to be
afraid of you again. Your nephew showed that
he had a tender heart when he was kind to Lizzie
Bean; and I believe he gets it honestly&mdash;<i>from
you</i>! <i>Dear</i> Professor Dimp!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said the old gentleman, drily, yet flushing
a little, too, &#8220;I can see very clearly that I
shall hereafter have very mediocre recitations
from the girls of Central High. They will no
longer fear me.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment the motorboat that had been
skimming across from the main land, pushed
her nose against the shore of the island. One of
the first persons to land was a gentleman with a
green bag in his hand who hurried up the hill to
greet the professor and his nephew, the much disheveled
Mr. Halliday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best of news Mr. Halliday&mdash;and you,
my dear Professor Dimp,&#8221; this gentleman said.
&#8220;The evidence is concluded. The guilty director
has been arrested and the reward for <i>your</i>
capture, Mr. Halliday, has been withdrawn. I
have come to take you back to Albany where your
name will be completely cleared of the false accusation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Bobby again, and waving
her hand at the dog and the sheriff on the other
side of the hill. &#8220;Come away, Barnacle; you
may let the sheriff down out of the tree.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>Dear me! It took nearly all day to explain
affairs, after all. The sheriff, and his bloodhounds,
and his posse departed unnoticed by the
rejoicing party in the camp of the Central High
girls.</p>
<p>The girls and boys made a hero out of Professor
Dimp. And he was not a bad sort after
all&mdash;as they found out upon closer acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall not let Professor Dimp hide his
light under a bushel,&#8221; cried Laura Belding, otherwise
Mother Wit. &#8220;Whenever there is anything
else exciting going on for the girls of Central
High, he shall be in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the males of the party later piled into the
<i>Bonnie Lass</i> to return to the boys&#8217; camp. There
the lawyer had left a team with which he was
going to take Norman Halliday out of the Big
Woods to the railway station.</p>
<p>But the professor promised to remain at least
another week, as the guest of the boys. That
week was the very jolliest week of all the vacation
at Lake Dunkirk, both for the boys, and for the
Girls of Central High.</p>
